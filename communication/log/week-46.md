Q: what do you want?

A: I am trying to support client-side geoprocessing. 
     - I desire geoprocessing to be more accessible.
     - I desire geoprocessing to be more sharable.
     - I want to be able to produce more powerful, more insightful geo web applications.
     - I want to discover if client-side geoprocessing has a future, or is a gimmick.
 
<!-- - *accessible*: This quality represents the advantage and reason of the pursuit of client-side geoprocessing. The ease of access and sharing the web represents, together with cross-platform advantages, form much of the reasoning behind the popularity of GIS web applications. This is why this study must examine if this quality is improved. -->

Q: How do you want to achieve this?

A: client-side geoprocessing is underresearched and underdeveloped in my opinion. 
   - I intend to perform both the research and development. 
   - I intend not to speculate, but to be convincing by example.
   - I intend to learn by doing, since the current obstacles are practical 
     and not theoretical in nature.

Q: What is the thesis?


RESEARCH QUESTION:

*How well can the **current state** of **standard client-side web technologies** make **existing geoprocessing libraries** **usable** in a browser?*

The research question is written as a "how well does X support Y question". 
To unpack its components: 

   - **current state**: This study will be timely. It will use contemporary, even bleeding edge features, but this means the findings are bound to this time of writing, and can easily change in the future. 

   - **standard client-side web technologies**: This phrase is meant in a first principles sense: Examine the raw, core technologies most major browsers offer without plugins or libraries. This study will cover: CSS, JS, HTML5, the DOM, WebGl, the 2d Canvas API, SVG's, and, its most recent addition, WebAssembly. 

   - **existing geoprocessing libraries**. This wording represents this studies desire to explore the usage of existing geoprocessing libraries, rather than to recreate geoprocessing libraries from scratch.

   - **usable**: This study intends to not only find out how the geo-libs can be **run** in a browser, but also how geo-libs be **used**. So besides covering qualities like performance, we will also be asking questions like: "how do we specify the input?", "how do we recieve the output?" and "how can multiple steps be chained together", which is a vital component of geoprocessing.
