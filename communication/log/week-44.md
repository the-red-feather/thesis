# The opportunity cost of bad UI
(small rant I cooked up when walking around, had to write it down somewhere, maybe it is useful)

Bad UI is absolutely detrimental to the field of geomatics 

From a sharing / education / communication POV: 
- It costs us souls: people will become discouraged to use tools if tools feel horrible to use. 
  - It will not attract new people to the field of geomatics
  - It will repell the general public from using geomatics tools.

From a workflow POV: 
- It takes up valuable time.
- It costs us energy: 
   - it is just not fun to deal with stupid problems all day. 
   - You do not feel smart after trying to find some function for an hour, it makes you feel stupid. 
   - Bad tools can really ruin your day.

From a scientific POV:
- bad UI leads to bad insight. 
  - Lots of operations and actions leading to a tiny sliver of insight has a small change of meaning anything, scientifically
- if exploration and experimentation is not fun and encouraged, people will not explore.
  - This will put a lit on discoveries. 
  - Positive accidents therefore are less likely to happen.


Don't throw the baby out with the bathwater. Salvaging operation: do not dismiss the tools, just move them to the 21st century
