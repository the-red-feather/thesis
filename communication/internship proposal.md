Allow me to go straight to the point: Would you be willing to supervise an internship at the company I currently work?

- Company: [Sfered](https://josfeenstra.nl/#sfered)
  - Parametric modelling of glasses, in order to make glasses fit perfectly. 

- Subject: web-based parametric cad.  
  - Sfered became interested in the open-source 3d library I wrote as a hobby project. 
  - Sfered would like to eventually use this environment to substitute large parts of their current pipeline, in order to enable client-side parametric modelling. It is already using [small bits](https://josfeenstra.nl/wip/facepoint-editor-2/) of it.   
  - But, before this can be realized, vital features are missing: 
    - Curves / Splines / BÃ¨zier curves
    - Curved Surfaces with holes
    - B-rep
    - Curve-Surface projections

  - My exercise will be to continue what I already started doing: using what 
  I have learned during DTM & 3DM to implement these features in the [open-source 3d engine](https://git.ldqk.org/josfeenstra/geon-engine) ive been building. I may or may not have to resort to using [OpenCascade](https://github.com/donalffons/opencascade.js), but I much rather implement only the relevant bits, to keep the application lightweight as possible. 

- My perspective is as follows:
  - Internships are often a leadup to a thesis, and this is similar to a degree.   
  - I find what I do for this company very much related to what im doing now at geomatics.
  - Most Importantly: I wish to gain 10 etcs for work which complements my thesis as opposed to 10 etcs worth of unrelated endevaours that will distract me from the thesis.\*

- Background info: 
  - Frederika agreed with this proposal, as long as I could guarantee there would be no conflict of interest. I believe the fact that all code I will write for this internship will be `open-source` will ensure this. I have been working for Sfered for the past three years now, and they have always allowed me to let study & education take precedence over work, as long as I communicate this clearly. 


I would love to have you, Ken & Stelios as internship supervisors. I know this is not entirely geomatics related. Still, I believe having practical experience with web-based geometry processing, and some insight in this use case, will be extremely beneficial to the thesis. If you agree to this, the internship will start next year in Q1.

I look forward hearing what you think of all this! 

<br/>

Cheers,

<br/>

> \*I have tried doing a couple of related electives, like the 'web programming languages' EWI course. They turned out to be not very relevant at the end, since  'web programming languages' for example, is a very broad topic. Maybe 5 percent of the knowledge & skills gained are applicable to my use case. I much rather make that something like 50%.
