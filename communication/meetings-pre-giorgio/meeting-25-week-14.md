# What I did
- (show thesis)
- Methodology is well on its way

# Friday meeting 

- **major conclusion**: delay is both inevitable, and a huge opportunity to 'do the thesis justice'.
  - inevitable: 
    - my current phase just is not enough & it became more and more desperate.
    - P4 would be either be a _very close call_ with lots of nightwork, or be a total flop.
  - opportunity:
    - I can now bring the written thesis to a higher level of quality. 
    - I might be able to do lots of bug / quality of life fixes, to make the app actually showable. 
    - I might be able to incorporate some of Hugo's suggestions in the code.
