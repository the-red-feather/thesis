# notes: 

research question: 

Can client-side geoprocessing using WebAssembly and a visual programming language make geoprocessing more `findable`, `accessible`, `interoperable`, and `reusable`?




This research aims to not only speculate whether client-side geoprocessing (CSGP) is possible, but to also make it into an actual viable option. 

Not only how it can be done, but also how it can be done _well_. To identify What is needed to make it actually useful to experts?
