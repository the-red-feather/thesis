This thesis presents GeoFront, a visual programming language similar to Grasshopper and FME, but web-based. 
With GeoFront, geoprocessing \& computational design flowcharts can be viewed, run, and shared using a browser.  
Applications include generating 3D city models according to custom specifications, urban analysis, and parametric modelling.
Geofront has been created as an experiment to explore if visual, 
browser-based geo-computation can make geo-computation in general more accessible. 
The advantages and disadvantages of browser based geo-computation, compared to native or server-side geo-computation, are examined in several scenario's. 
This study concludes that based on these assessments, browser-based geo-computation through VPLs is viable, and an enabler of many promising features, such as on-demand geodata processing apps, educational demo apps, and code sharing. 
However, extensive user-group testing is required before any definitive statements on accessibility and fitness for geo-computation can be made.
