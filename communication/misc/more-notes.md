Personal motivation (which does not belong in the thesis)
=========

The central hypothesis of this study is that:
- A: Given the similarities of the field of GIS with other applied CG fields,
- And B: Given the success of VPLs within some of these other fields as a tool to bridge the gap between library and application,
- Then C: The field of GIS stands to gain much from further investigation into VPLs.

I wanted to get at 'creative turing completeness' for VPLs




other notes
==============

I wanted to comment on why I did not fully use the suggestions regarding 'cloud native' you gave a while back. 
I really agreed with the suggestion of framing the VPL as maybe a 'cloud computation platform', and since then have tried to incorporate aspects of the movement.

I have tried to reframe the thesis to incorporate those aspects. 
Regrettably, every time I tried it, it only led the already sizable scope of this thesis to become larger still. 


To still present something, I tried to meet the cloud-native aspect half way.
Sections have been added discussing scalability, a headless runtime, and the importance of static web application without an active back-end.
