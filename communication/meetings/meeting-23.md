- because OGC 

OGC 

the fact is evident of the overall trend

I think there is a confusion
vagueness 

Cloud <---> Local Y : data 

Native <---> High level X : app

Interactivity means something different 

download install use 

install only once

play card: someone can package it 


kill the interactivity argument

- dont fully commit, 

list multiple benefits 
mid-level : not highest level performance, not high level coding 

- OGC cloud native -> could be strong point, but not the main

- intro: just good characteristics 
  - 

- and very simple. 1 sentence 

- at the end: go full ham

cloud vs native 
native vs browser

Fair Geodata -> Fair Geodata processing


...

This will mean that certain post-processing and rendering responsibilities 

This will mean that certain post-processing and rendering duties will have to move from the back-end to front-end environments, 
whenether these front-ends are native (like QGIS) or web-based. 
...
unsure if especially the browser-based tools are up to this challenge 

Therefore, this thesis investigates ...


Investigate the diverse possibilities of browser-based geoprocessing. 

Accessibility, Accessibility, Accessibility

Application which is able to consume low-level geoprocessing libraries written in C++ and Rust,
