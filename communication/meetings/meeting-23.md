- dont fully commit, 

list multiple benefits 
mid-level : not highest level performance, not high level coding 

- OGC cloud native -> could be strong point, but not the main

- intro: just good characteristics 
  - 

- and very simple. 1 sentence 

- at the end: go full ham

cloud vs native 
native vs browser
