# Recap week 3-4

# Original Plan for week 3-4

- [X] The question of Object Oriented Programming -> Procedural Programming.
  - [X] _Should_ we convert it automatically?
     - IF YES: 
        - [X] _How_ to convert automatically?
     - IF NO: We could always just force people to write a pure function wrapper library around an existing codebase. 

- [ ] Improve Input & Output
  - The next thing we REALLY need is a major 'widget' improvement. We want special types of input, and special types of output (visualizers)

- [ ] HTML, the big framework question


- [ ] _week 4 / 5:_ Add Geon Engine as STD
  - We need some base types like vectors, meshes, and whatnot, and some basic functions to do meaningful things with these objects
  - [ ] what to do with js TypedArray's ? these will be crucial for all geoprocessing, and translation between Wasm / processing on the one hand, and Js / Visuals on the other 

- [ ] _week 4 / 5:_ What to do with Flow management in the flowchart (especially the loop and if statement)  

- After these things, Phase 2 and  Phase 3 are sort of done (I want to shorten Phase 3 ). We can start Phase 1. 

# Notes During meeting



### Questions / remarks regarding the recap? 

- differences betweem react (functional programming) / vua (oop) 

[SV]:
- you use webpack -> its bloated
- stelios: had problem, had to use 
- web workers
- `parcel.js` 
- nice background :) 

[KA]
- push the geomatics side 
- triangles, meshes, objects
- modules which do real geomatics stuff
-gdal
- chat -> header file 
- random stuff to help with debugging

[SV]
- optimizations are weird, and not only js is subject to these kinds of things


- long story short: premature optimization is the root of all evil :).
