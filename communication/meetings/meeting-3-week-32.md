## NOTES 

The introduction, related works, and methodology chapters are all finished. Well, they are likely not finished, but they are at least filled with text, and coherent :).

- Regarding the methodology: The new plan is the old plan, just slightly altered, but with significant consequences.
- The story is clear and meaningful in my ears.
  - I could even boil it down further, but I think this is a good start



## finished for next meeting :

- continue with the Implementation chapter.
  - parts of which the implementation is done can be filled in, like 4.1, 4.2.1, 4.3

-  I need to perform two studies:
  - one: testing with compiling a geoprocessing operation. Js vs. C++ vs. Rust 
  - two: building *A* use-case application, both as a Geofront App, and as a CLI tool. 
    - the whole point of this is to 'unit test' a library 'you' supposedly wrote. 

- Then, write about those

- After these 4 weeks, i'll have chapter 4 and 5 for the most part finished. 
  Then only the conclusion is left.
