# 0. Introduction

Hi all!

# 1. What has been done?

- in general, I'm glad to say that the entire structure of the written thesis has crystallized to an extend (if, of course, there are no major objections). 
All chapters and subchapters are set, and I am in general pleased with the story. 

- The introduction and methodology chapters are 'filled'. 
  They are probably not finished, but they are at least filled with text, and coherent :).

- Related works, half finished, working hard on it. Plan to be done with it at the end of this week. 

- Regarding the methodology: The new plan is the old plan, just slightly altered, but with significant consequences. I'm basing the methodology yet again on the sub-questions.

- Spreaking of which, I have new main and supporting research questions. Maybe the phrasing can be a bit better, but I think the general aspects they signal to are good. 

# 2. Where are we currently? (regarding the planning)

- A little more than 7 weeks left to the P4 according to my schedule. 
  - Are we on schedule? 
    - I think so. 

# 3. Questions

- First of all: research questions & attached methodology, What do you think?

- Balancing of Introduction, Related works, & Methodology. 
  - Did you guys find anything in these chapters that should belong somewhere else?
  - I'm giving lots of explanations in the methodology chapter, some of which I feel like they should belong to the introduction. 

- Should I add 'use case' chapter to introduction? to be clear about the creation of Geofront / 
  A prototype geo-web-vpl? 

- I have some confusion about where to put which 'sub-methodology execution'.
  - What belongs in 'Implementation' vs 'Results' vs 'Experiments'?

# 4. What needs to be done for next meeting? 

Next meeting will probably be 4 weeks for now

- finish the related works 

- finish the conclusion to the extend that is possible

- finish the implementation to the extend that is possible
  - parts of which the implementation is done can be filled in, like 4.1, 4.2.2, 4.3

- IF TIME LEFT, but only if the written thesis is as 'done' as possible, I will return to writing the required software, and doing the required analysis for the final two experiments. 

-  I need to perform two studies:
  - one: testing with compiling a geoprocessing operation. Js vs. C++ vs. Rust 
  - two: building *A* use-case application, both as a Geofront App, and as a CLI tool. 
    - the whole point of this is to 'unit test' a library 'you' supposedly wrote. 


# 5. Administrative things

- Are the P4 & P5 still good? do we need to flag these dates somewhere? 
  - as I am writing this, I believe Ken said that the table opens up at the start of the new academic year. If that is the case, we will wait for that.
