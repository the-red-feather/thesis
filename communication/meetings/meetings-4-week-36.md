## HWAT DO i WANT
- I want to finish some of the pressing issues of geofront
- I want the thesis to be finished and of sufficient quality
  - That is why I want to get my hands on some data. To be able to show something of substance
  ]\






## Thoughts

- I find it weird to write the analysis chapter. 
  - I can only give written comments, I have no data. 

## Questions: 

<!-- - I'm looking for a good source on geocomputation / geodata. 
  Just generic things, like 'different types of geodata'
   -->
- What needs the most work? 
- What feels the most incomplete?

## Known Issues 

- Background & related works is too long! 


## LOG 

### Dag 1

(24 august | after two weeks of work):
- alright, chap 1,2,3,4 is more or less done
  - 1) I have the story down 
  - 2) 3) I know everyhing thanks to the background & related works 
  - 4) I have the methodology down

Now its time to truly DO the study. 
But how to proceed? 
- conclusion is a mess, lots of fragments.
- unsure about the balance between Implementation, Analysis, experiments, discussion. 
- I still need to perform some of these aspects. 

...

Also, what is my schedule for finishing these things? 

(29 August)
- just filled the full conclusion! of course it is quicky written, and not completely finished, but it is finished enough for our purposes right now

MAANDAG: 
- kijk hoe ver je komt met de implementatie afronden 
-
