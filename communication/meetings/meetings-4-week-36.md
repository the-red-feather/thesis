# 0. Introduction

Hi all!

# 1. What has been done?

- almost all chapters have been filled in! 
- continued with the code to get some geodata on the canvas, which was a success:
  - COPC files can now be loaded and visualized
  

# 2. Where are we currently? 

- Background & related works is too long! 
- Editorial work still incomplete (sources, images, diagrams, abbreviations)
- 'strange analysis chapter' -> can't put my word on it, but the analysis chapter needs some changes
- Missing parts in the implementation and analysis chapters, working on that


# 3. Questions

- I really wish to know where I'm at: 
    - How is the narrative?
    - What should really be in order for the P4? 
    - Are there any crucial parts missing?
    - Are there any parts of the thesis 'unacceptable'?

- I find it weird to write the analysis chapter. 
  - I can only give written comments, I have no data. 

- I built a 'personal reflection' this week, should I include that in the final meeting

# 4. What needs to be done for next meeting? 

- All editorial work finished 
  - no missing images 
  - no missing sources
  - no sentences stopping randomly
  - no missing abbreviations

- The studies referred to have to be conducted.

- The remaining empty chapters 5.2 and 6.2 should be filled  

# 5. Administrative: 

- P4 all set? 
- Hugo?
