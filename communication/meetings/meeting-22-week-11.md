# Commentary
- I was getting really stuck and disheartened by the middle of last week by just the sheer amount of work left to do. I'm behind schedule in terms of writing, and geofront is half-finished. I don't like the fact that I have to split my attention between both. I decided to get out of this slump by just trying to do SOMETHING meaningful, to achieve some sort of progress, in a simple way. This is why I focussed on geofront. 
- have experimented a lot with different STD's, settled on just an internal one. Bit more annoying to develop, 
  but it was the easiest to just get working, and the easiest to integrate with the rest of geofront.
- I Finally figured out how to 'organize' the std. 'organize', since I wouldn't dare call the current setup organized, But at the very least, I can now add more and more things to geofront without the feeling like things are getting out of hand. 
  - I solved this issue by constraint relaxation: I'm forgoing typechecking or type-auto-conversion for the time being, but i'm setting things up so they can be added incrementally later, without too much trouble.
