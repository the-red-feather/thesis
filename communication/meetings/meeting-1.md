# meeting 1 

Ken, Stelios & me had our first talk. Kind of all over the place, mainly due to my lack of preparation (and sleep, thanks to Koningsdag). What was important to me was their general opinion of the topic. I was very happy to hear many concrete use-cases this research could have, and Ken & Stelios' general openness to the ideas.


The thesis could go in a number of directions. from making a Rust + Wasm version of GDAL to developing something akin to FME but on the web. Will I only develop a library, or will I actually also create some implementation of the library? I prefer the latter, to truly stress-test, and to 'eat your own dog food', as designers tend to say. What shape or form this could take remains unclear. 


During the talk, I discovered that that I need to be more specific of what I plan to do. I will work on more documentation & sketches of the current state of affairs. 



# TODO for next meeting: 
- See what rust libraries are out there:
  - spatial geometry processing tools 
  - rendering 
  
- Make the focus clear of the library. 'geometry processing' is a bit to broad. Ken proposes 'triangulation' as just something that is always very much needed. 
- Plan an actual date for the meeting
