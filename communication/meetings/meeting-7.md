Overall
-------
This week, I started working on the P2 Thesis proposal. 

I'm still figuring out a ton, and i'm writing small bits all over the place. 
This week I wanted to focus on getting the whole environment set up: native latex, a nice clean repo, citation managers (just today found out those things exist, super nice tools!). 
Additionally, I want to focus on background research (other papers), and defining a clear research question



Planning
--------
besides handing in P1, I haven't been able to make any process last week. 
I noticed that the internship work required too much brain juice to do it 'on the side', and it also had a tendency to 'spill over' onto the time reserved for the thesis. 
This is why I now choose to do the internship work every other week, for a full week long. 
This also means that this week and every 2nd week from now until February will be fully focused on the thesis"

How and when would you like to recieve in-between content? file dumbs in discord? pdf's? or is the repo enough?



P2: Thesis Proposal
-----------------------------
- LaTeX setup
  - Tips about setup? styling? citations?

- Introduction
  - Shall I make a separate paper as an in-depth analysis and judgement of existing VPL's? I feel like this might be needed to make a proper case for this thesis.

- References 
  - Does Ravi have a paper about geoflow?



Internship 
----------
- Stuck in sub-problems, but those problems are making me fill the engine with new features. 
  - features: 
    - image processing
    - phong shading
