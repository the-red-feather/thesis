Planning
--------

- "besides handing in P1, I haven't been able to make any process last week. 
    I noticed that the internship work required too much brain juice to do it 'on the side', and it also had a tendency to 'spill over' onto the time reserved for the thesis. 
    This is why I now choose to do the internship work every other week, for a full week long. 
    This also means that this week and every 2nd week from now until February will be fully focused on the thesis"
