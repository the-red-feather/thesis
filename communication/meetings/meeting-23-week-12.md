# Recap TODO Week 11
WRITING
- [X] cleanup the latex project (references / acronyms are giving errors, packages used are not the same as P2). 
- [X] refine and narrow the narrative, 
- [ ] fun task: make a nice cover

CODING
- [ ] Geofront: continue the cleanup & STD
  - Add Json & XYZ again, and properly
  
- [X] add Startin properly, figure out how to integrate types
   - Can easely be done with [inspectable](https://rustwasm.github.io/docs/wasm-bindgen/reference/attributes/on-rust-exports/inspectable.html)

- [ ] add generic plugin support
  - [X] load json using url
  - [X] make an overview page of all loaded plugins, 
  - [ ] and create a way to add & load new ones
  - [ ]  

(- [ ] add the cgal demo-project properly
   - Not sure, maybe [this](https://emscripten.org/docs/api_reference/preamble.js.html#preamble-js))

## Discussion 

- because OGC 
OGC 
the fact is evident of the overall trend

I think there is a confusion
vagueness 

Cloud <---> Local Y : data 

Native <---> High level X : app

Interactivity means something different 

download install use 

install only once

play card: someone can package it 


kill the interactivity argument

- dont fully commit, 
list multiple benefits 
mid-level : not highest level performance, 
not high level coding 

- OGC cloud native -> could be A strong point, but not the main

- intro: just good characteristics 
  - 
- and very simple. 1 sentence 

- at the end: go full ham

cloud vs native 
native vs browser

 

- table of content 
  - introduction
  - 
  - justification 


accessibility : more cloud 

Related work

Use case chapter 
- NOT JUSTIFIING, BUT MOTIVATION 

INTRO: JUST BRING UP A PROBLEM THATS MEANINGFUL ENOUGH TO INVESTIGATE 
- How will geoprocessing work in a world were more and more tools will be cloud-native 
- accessibility in a cloud-moving world 
- case studies at results : experiments 

- CONCLUSION: WAS 

- sfered argument, before intro
- 

- leave things behind 
- 

Table of content 
- 
- 3.1 , 3.2 skip them , move to intro, simplyfy X
- conclusion in related work: dont -> make it samenvatting C
3.4 should be own chapter 
- Methodology
  - P2: mention 
  - Assessment: the ideas of experimentations 
- Software architecture -> implementation
- The Why

- Implmenetation 
- Execution -> Experimentation
- Use cases: 

4.1 software architecture 
4.2 achieved functionality 
6. -> 5. Experiments & Results 
7. -> 6. Discussion -> your results 
   -> 

7. Conclusion 
 - main conclusion 
 - future 
 - 

- reproducability 
  - Put here what you put into 


Appendix 




...
Fair Geodata -> Fair Geodata processing


This will mean that certain post-processing and rendering responsibilities 

This will mean that certain post-processing and rendering duties will have to move from the back-end to front-end environments, 
whenether these front-ends are native (like QGIS) or web-based. 
...
unsure if especially the browser-based tools are up to this challenge 

Therefore, this thesis investigates ...


Investigate the diverse possibilities of browser-based geoprocessing. 

Accessibility, Accessibility, Accessibility

Application which is able to consume low-level geoprocessing libraries written in C++ and Rust,
