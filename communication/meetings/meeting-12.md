Hey Jos! I had a good look at your P2 doc today
in short: I like it a lot and don't think it's worth spending more time to improve it
the new intro is very nice
really like the summary of obstacles
the related work is well written and a good summary
the latter sections are as we discussed
nitpicking a bit:
1. maybe in the first paragraph you should talk about browser-based viewers only?
because you call them GIS, but in the second paragraph you say that they're basically viewers
which seems a bit misleading
2. for the obstacles, I'd go for more precise titles
the first could be something like CSG is technically challenging?
the second "relies on immature technologies"?
for the third, I'd tone it down: not optimal for every use case
unnecesary is too strong for the argument you have there IMO
3. then, in 1.3 you talk about how these are interdependent, which is great
but then I'd expect you to explain how and why
(it's a very nice and strong argument)
anyway, as I said, I wouldn't spend much time on the P2 doc
it's in a very good state ðŸ™‚
