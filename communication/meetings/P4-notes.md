P4 Notes: Changelog and questions 
==========================


Changelog
==========================
- Added an abstract
- Changed the introduction completely, with exception to the very first part, and the part after the research questions.
- Removed irrelevant parts of Chapter 2 and 3, rewritten some parts to be more formal and to the point.
- Modified Chapter 4 and 5 and added large parts to offer a better balance between the two chapters, and to explain the methodology more thoroughly
  - removed the components which should have been in the introduction. 
- Added chapter 6.1, the results of the tests performed. 
  - The most drafty part of the paper currently, please let me know what you expect for P5. 
- Added a personal reflection to end of the conclusion.
  - Not sure if it belong in a thesis, so i'm including it now to hear what you think. 

- Of course, I have incorporated all your feedback, including:
  - the shared comment of having 'pieces of the introduction / conclusion everywhere'. 
    Ive removed these types of pieces as much as I can identify them. 
    Please let me know if some parts are still too much filled with reasons, too "insecure", as Stelios put it. 
  - Stelios' comments on the bold statements, the citations, and the missing compilation tests. 
  - Giorgio's various comments (the 'to what exten**t**' statements should be fixed now, thank you for pointing out those blunders :) ).
  - Ken's comment on the introduction, the related works, and the balance between chapter 4 and 5. 


Known Issues
==========================
- The research questions still do not quite cover what I have done, will look into this

- Chapter 4, 5 and 6 require some more attention. 
  - I've noticed that I repeat myself quite often.
    I think this is because I was not sure if I already said something relevant in the chapter before.

- I think Chapter 2 and 3 are 'left behind' right now. 
  - Some parts are still more relevant than other parts. 
  - Also, there are some things I say or use in chapter 4, 5, and 6, that were not properly explained in chapter 2. Examples of this are emscripten, or CGAL. 
  - However, a complete rewrite would be too much work.
  - Would love to hear your take on this.

- The Bibliography is still a bit raw, more data needs to be added to the 'Zotero' 
  sources manager I am using


Practical Questions
==========================
- Where can I find the nicer thesis latex template? Many of the 3D geo papers use a nicer and more readable template than the one i'm using (Ravi Peter's Hydrographic thesis, Konstantinos' 3D City version control thesis)
- How should I style the (pseudo) code bits? Are screenshots acceptable? currently looking into Minted, expect something better for P5.
- Would more images and diagrams to explain various things in chapter 1, 4 and 5 be helpful?


Looking forward to your feedback!
