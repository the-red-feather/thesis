# notes from ken 18/12/2021
Hello Jos! so, I had a good look at your doc between yesterday and today
my general impression is that all the required elements are there, but they're kind of spread out all over the place -> AGREE!
there's indeed some repetition too
and there is not a single coherent story at this point
instead, you have a lot of observations (which are good), but the doc doesn't really flow at this point

my advice would actually be to start from a blank document
maybe with the traditional P2 structure from the website
and to copy and paste the important text from your current doc to the new one in the right places
you could follow one typical structure: intro/motivation/research questions, related work, methodology, what's done so far/preliminary results, planning

for the intro, I think you can come up with something shorter and sharper 
think of how you would explain your topic to one of your relatives in 1 minute
for instance, maybe you could narrow it down to only geoprocessing and VPLs
no need to start from geomatics

for the related work, I'd shorten it too
you don't need to describe whole papers section by section
just summarise the main findings and their relevance to your work
and if a reference is not directly related to either your motivation or your methodology, I'd skip it for now
(keep them for your thesis)

for the rest, I think you still need to implement the **things we've discussed**ðŸ™‚ -> [Jos] don't know what you specifically mean by that
anyway, I think you're on the right track, but also that the doc has grown a lot and it's time to reorganise it to have a good story and to sharpen the arguments in it
