Lessons
==========

- give yourself clear todo's per day. 
  Not too little, not too much.
  Upon completion, the day falls apart


TODO
============

high-level
----------

[ ] The intro / story needs to be altered 
    - stronger tie to Geo & web
    - VPL + Web

[ ] rewrite and balance research questions

- [ ] than trickle down the consequences of those changes throughout the thesis
- [ ] and fix all that needs to be fixed (images and stuff)
- [ ] put TODO notes everywhere
mid-level
---------

[ ] Deep dive in Hugo's comments, fix those aspects 
  - [x] sort acronyms

[ ] Add a stronger web-component in the introduction (presentation)
[ ] Add cloud native / cloud-based geodata component to the introduction  

[ ] Cleanup Chapter 2 and 3.  
  - Some parts are still more relevant than other parts. 
  - Also, there are some things I say or use in chapter 4, 5, and 6, that were not properly explained in chapter 2. Examples of this are emscripten, or CGAL. 
  - However, a complete rewrite would be too much work.
  - Would love to hear your take on this.

[ ] Make chapter 4 and 5 more streamlined 
  - I've noticed that I repeat myself quite often.
  - I think this is because I was not sure if I already said something relevant in the chapter before.

[ ] Show your results more clearly, do the coding you have done justice

[ ] finish chapter 6 properly 
  - Experiments: add a section on a use-case application, using potree + startin + geofront std + obj downloader

[ ] write stronger, more clear conclusions.
  - hmm, i think they are already quite clear. But again, this is to be reconsidered when the overall story of the thesis changes  

low-level 
-------------------

- [x] Add arsclassica template to the thesis
- [x] Make the code snippets / listings work properly
- [x] replace all code screenshot with proper listings
- [ ] create all missing uml diagrams
- [ ] add proper graphs for the data you've gathered 
- [ ] Add all proper metadata to Zotero, for a nice bibliography
