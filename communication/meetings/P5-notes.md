Personal motivation (which does not belong in the thesis)
=========

The central hypothesis of this study is that:
- A: Given the similarities of the field of GIS with other applied CG fields,
- And B: Given the success of VPLs within some of these other fields as a tool to bridge the gap between library and application,
- Then C: The field of GIS stands to gain much from further investigation into VPLs.

I wanted to get at 'creative turing completeness' for VPLs
