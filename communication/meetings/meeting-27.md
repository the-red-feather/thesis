# status report
It has been a month since I delayed the thesis. What has happened since then? 
- Job searching: extremely busy!
- Thesis on the backburner sadly.
- Written many, MANY introductions, but otherwise, i'm quite stuck...
- My biggest question right now: what are my new research questions? I have a few ideas, but I would love to hear yours.

# Notes during meeting


healthy wasting of time: going back and forth to methodology, introduction


Ken: Don't like it!
L argument from autority
L long argument
L weak argument


Vpls: do like it!
L what is happening now: cloud computing
L rely vpl,

now is a moment moving more to cloud sollutions

1. VPL -> first argument
2. reproducability


as will be discuss in this thesis -> 
migration -> desktop cloud


containerization: great for background: 
no complex things in the introductions


you have 2 arguments: 
Web : cloud + reproducability 
VPL : vpl arguments

containerization is too early

good for containerization -> whats the link between this with all the things you mentioned


# INTRO
