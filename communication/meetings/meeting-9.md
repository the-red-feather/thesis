## Things that happened since the last meeting:
- Completely rewritten introduction
- Found more relevant papers
  - Read introductions & conclusions of each
  - Added my comments & why it is relevant to the P2 prototype
- Meet up with Ravi
  - Talked about "geodata processing user experience" & the case for a geodata vpl
  - Ravi explained his design decisions while making it
  - Talked about the properties a geodata vpl should have, like being able to run GUI-less
- Internship
  - created a linalg library ðŸ˜…
  - Implemented least squares circle, and some interesting heuristics



## Notes during the meeting


**Thin-client vs Thick Client**
  - The part where thin-client side is mentioned needs some work:
  - The case for a thick client is important. If this is not well-made, the whole thesis starts crumbling down
  - **Be Honest**
    - Combination of down & upsides 
  - "in certain applications"
  - Some parts are too technical
    - push the narrative closer to the user, rather than the technology 
  - Thick-client has many more **advantages**: 
    - The Scale / size of a geo-app: thick clients enable larger geo-apps
    - Better Privacy 
    - Less Storage needed
    - No connections have to be made and maintained, no session tokens, no advanced servers.

  - All in all: major advantage is a thick client means a more lean server design. 
    - This means less complexity and maintenance on the side of the server, driving down costs.
    - Not useful for all geodata applications, but it will be useful for certain scenarios.

  - Exploratory is another advantage


**Methodology**
  - Benchmark
  - Make promises 
  - Software requirements
  - It should show what to expect at P4  
  - Plan
  - Scope



  
# Notes later from Ken on Discord: 

the doc looks well overall
you ideas seem a lot clearer now
the first paragraph is nice, 

but I don't think it's very suitable to start the document
it's more the kind of thing that you can put in your conclusions 
(something strong and opinionated)
instead, I think you can start by saying that web applications are popular
explain the benefits briefly
apart from having no installation

by the way, there's no need to say that the vast majority are web applications
it doesn't help your argument
then, I think you can make a better argument for your thesis overall
explain that historically, thin client fat server was the standard
for the reasons you listed
and then directly explain why this is potentially changing now

the stuff you have in "the case" and "the problem" is nice, but I think it's too detailed for the P2
for the rest: my advice is to develop further the methodology
focus on that
define steps better and provide a rough timeline 
it would be great if you have a research subquestion that could be answered by each step

# Action I will undertake based on these notes:

[] 1. Finish methodology
  - Define steps, then research sub-questions for every step

[] 2. Clarify introduction
  - Less in-depth
  - Less opinionated

[] 3. Related works
