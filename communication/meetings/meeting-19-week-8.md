# .1. Introduction


# .2. Results from last meeting
## - Geojson exploration

![](../../P4/material/week-7.png)
Succes! We can show (basic) geojsons, and we can even apply conditional formatting
Multiple things had to be created to make this succeed: 
- controllable iteration / looping tools 
- 'getters' to explore a json file 
- Finding and integrating a triangulator 
- Renderer which allows for conditional formatting
- Tools to allow contitional formatting, like 'conditions' themselves :)

A higher level-way of accessing a geojson will eventually be desired I think, but this works for now, and I think it is a nice feature that this tool is able to deal with raw data processing.

## - Geo-retrieval exploration
