# WEEK 00 / 15

## FRI | 5 nov 2021 | Halting development

![state of the art](../images/10-45_05-11-2021.PNG)

Prototype status: all sorts of different things are possible at the moment. js - script conversion, saving to and loading from json. Objects, button gizmo's, log console, text input, etc. 

Right now, mostly working on P2 paper. consequently, little progress with the flowchart application. 

I am considering a do-over of the flow-chart rendering. We need svg based rendering in my opinion.  SVG's would allow us to: 
- Re-render things less. We can just rely on browser-based scrolling. This has got to be more efficient than the Canvas based scrolling we are doing right now. 
- This plays nicer with the browser as a GUI environment. canvas API is great for rendering images dynamically, but we will be dealing with vector graphics. 
- use CSS for styling the components, allowing easy re-skins
- clicking on things using the svg boundaries, cuz why not

# WEEK 01 / 15 | generate momentum again to start development

- You are now finally allowed to continue development, but the writing introduced many considerations, resulting in choice paralysis. Find a component small enough to continue development, and make something

## TODO:
- [ ] Make configuring the graph feature complete, fun and intuitive
- [ ] 

## TUE | 08 feb 2021 | Picking up the pieces | FOCUS: UI

Finally picking up where I left off. The Thesis proposal and presentation are finished, quite satisfied with both. The writing did generate a ton of new ideas which now make it hard to continue the work. 


## THU | 10 feb 2022 | Starting up 
quite pleased with the cyberpunky look
