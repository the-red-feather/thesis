# PHASE 2: 
- most coding is done
- however, both the story of the written thesis, as well as the written thesis itself, leaves much to be desired. 
- fix this!

[ ] intro: decided upon placing this thesis in between VPL research, and web GIS research
[ ] reading guide: given structure to the entire thesis 

## thu
[x] build a framework for chapter 2
[x] analyse the vpl papers, write about it
[x] define problems from vpl papers
[x] clean up related work somewhat

"geo-vpls have advantages and a reason of existence. web apps have advantages and a reason of existence
by creating a web-geo-vpl, we wish to
- combine these advantages, and to create certain synergies.
- fill-in uncharted territory

  -> is it at least a plausible option?
  -> The numerous technical & architectural considerations of this method take precidence within this thesis. 
-> A subsequenct study must be conducted to properly compare this new method against existing, comparable methods
  -> 

web -> meant for end-user GIS 
vpl -> meant for end-user applications
geo-vpl -> meant for insight into complex spatial operations / debugging
------------------------------
WEB + GEO + VPL -> meant for end-user GIS app creation, and gaining an educational / debug / understanding of GIS spatial operations.  


synergies: 
- challenge within vpls: distribution and life-cycle of apps created with the vpl. 
  - solution: web-based distribution
- challenge within vpls: expansion through plugins 
  - solution: utilize javascript CDN's, and typescript header files. 


[ ] clean up methodology
[ ] clearly state the requirements within methodology
[ ] clearly state the use-case applications and experiments 
  [ ] which experiments
[ ] take inspiration from ravi & ellie
[ ] think about how this flows towards implementation & experiments


# fri
[x] make presentation
[-] write conclusion
