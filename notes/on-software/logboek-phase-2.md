# PHASE 2: 
- most coding is done
- however, both the story of the written thesis, as well as the written thesis itself, leaves much to be desired. 
- fix this!

[ ] intro: decided upon placing this thesis in between VPL research, and web GIS research
[ ] reading guide: given structure to the entire thesis 

## thu
[x] build a framework for chapter 2
[x] analyse the vpl papers, write about it
[x] define problems from vpl papers
[x] clean up related work somewhat

"geo-vpls have advantages and a reason of existence. web apps have advantages and a reason of existence
by creating a web-geo-vpl, we wish to
- combine these advantages, and to create certain synergies.
- fill-in uncharted territory

  -> is it at least a plausible option?
  -> The numerous technical & architectural considerations of this method take precidence within this thesis. 
-> A subsequenct study must be conducted to properly compare this new method against existing, comparable methods
  -> 

web -> meant for end-user GIS 
vpl -> meant for end-user applications
geo-vpl -> meant for insight into complex spatial operations / debugging
------------------------------
WEB + GEO + VPL -> meant for end-user GIS app creation, and gaining an educational / debug / understanding of GIS spatial operations.  


synergies: 
- challenge within vpls: distribution and life-cycle of apps created with the vpl. 
  - solution: web-based distribution
- challenge within vpls: expansion through plugins 
  - solution: utilize javascript CDN's, and typescript header files. 


[ ] clean up methodology
[ ] clearly state the requirements within methodology
[ ] clearly state the use-case applications and experiments 
  [ ] which experiments
[ ] take inspiration from ravi & ellie
[ ] think about how this flows towards implementation & experiments


# fri
[x] make presentation
[-] write conclusion

==============================================

## Phase: Finishing the written thesis

(24 august | after two weeks of work):
- alright, chap 1,2,3,4 is more or less done
  - 1) I have the story down 
  - 2) 3) I know everyhing thanks to the background & related works 
  - 4) I have the methodology down

Now its time to truly DO the study. 
But how to proceed? 
- conclusion is a mess, lots of fragments.
- unsure about the balance between Implementation, Analysis, experiments, discussion. 
- I still need to perform some of these aspects. 

...

Also, what is my schedule for finishing these things? 

(29 August)
- just filled the full conclusion! of course it is quicky written, and not completely finished, but it is finished enough for our purposes right now'

(5 September)
- Almost everything is done, but not quite. Lets dedicate these days to filling up the remaining holes! 
- fill up 6.1
- fill up 5.2.1, 6.2.1
- then, to the research required
- then, fill up 5.2.2 and 6.2.2
