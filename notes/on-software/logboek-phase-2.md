# PHASE 2: 
- most coding is done
- however, both the story of the written thesis, as well as the written thesis itself, leaves much to be desired. 
- fix this!

[ ] reading guide: given structure to the entire thesis 

## thu
[x] build a framework for chapter 2
[x] analyse the vpl papers, write about it
[x] define problems from vpl papers
[x] clean up related work somewhat

"geo-vpls have advantages and a reason of existence. web apps have advantages and a reason of existence
by creating a web-geo-vpl, we wish to
- combine these advantages, and to create certain synergies.
- fill-in uncharted territory

synergies: 
- challenge within vpls: distribution and life-cycle of apps created with the vpl. 
  - solution: web-based distribution
- challenge within vpls: plugin creation & distribution
  - solution: utilize javascript CDN's, and typescript header files. 

[ ] clear up methodology
[ ] clearly state the requirements within methodology
[ ] clearly state the use-case applications and experiments 
  [ ] which experiments
[ ] take inspiration from ravi & ellie
[ ] think about how this flows towards implementation & experiments
