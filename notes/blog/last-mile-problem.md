## 1. The Last-mile problem 
Most geo-processing research and development is done in a, I would say, limited context.
I've noticed that a common problem occurs when people try to actually create something for end users out of tools and libraries developed for geomatics purposes. During that very last step, it often proofs to be very difficult to utilize and access all this research. This 'last mile' problem stems from a lack of interoperability, which this thesis partially tries to solve.

# The Last Mile problem
Geofront is created to solve a problem dubbed as "the last mile problem." This article attempts to explain what is meant by that, and why this is relevant.

## The Last Mile Problem in other fields 
The "last mile problem" is a well-known phenomenon present in both the field of logistics and urban planning. In logistics, it refers to the final distribution step, like a door-to-door delivery at the end of a long chain of logistics. In urban planning, the problem refers to the journey a traveler makes _after_ having made a journey by public transport, often done by foot or by bike.

Even though these distances might seem trivial compared to a substantial logistical chain or a long train journey, they nonetheless play a key role, maybe even *The* most important role. It does not matter if a parcel traveled half the globe, or if a traveler arrives in the city of destination. If the last mile is too cumbersome, or it takes too long, customers will choose other services. This is why these miles are marked as a "problem" by both industries / fields of study. Finding solutions for overcoming these miles are vital to the entire enterprise.   

<!-- This idea of diminishing returns is echoed by the famous 80/20 rule, which states that the first 80 percent of work can be done in half the time needed for a particular project, but that the last 20 percent of work requires the other half.  -->

## How does this relate to geomatics?
The field of geomatics also deals with problems of distribution. This is most often dubbed as "Operations" or joined with development as "DevOps". Like the aforementioned fields, these logistics also deal with multiple levels: Sharing software between developers is a different process entirely than sharing software from a developer to end-users, let alone sharing software _between_ end users.

I would argue that the field of geomatics also has a "Last Mile Problem". A

Like the aforementioned fields of study: If the last mile cannot be overcome, it is like the entire service didn't exist in the first place. 


Most geodata processing and analysis tools do not end up in the hands of anyone but the researchers, or other specific experts in the field. 
This limits the interdisciplinary exchange of ideas. 
It also compromises the return of investment the general public should expect of _publicly_ funded research.    
This research seeks to improve the accessibility of geodata processing and analysis tools, without adding major changes to those tools, or adding additional responsibilities researches.
It will do this 
The research offers a proof of concept application called: "Geofront".
