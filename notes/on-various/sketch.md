# Ideas for engine

- "GDAL-like" Algorithms
  - DT
  - Conf/Cons DT (also needed for rendering polygons)
  - Simple KD tree 


# Ideas for implementation
- Triangulation
- Mass Intersection (polygon queries)


### improving the client-side performance of geometry processing & modelling in Geo-web applications by utilizing Rust & WebAssembly 











### Intro from a visual programming language's perspective

In recent years, the demand for parametric design modelling has increased. Parametric design has entered the domains of Industrial Design & Architecture in the form of Mcneel's Grasshopper, Autodesks Dynamo, as well as industry standards 

Where these technologies fail to meet demands, however, is on the level of accessibility and interactivity. Parametric designs are often difficult to publish, because the models have close ties to certain software packages & computation geometry libraries. 

This issue is mirrored by web maps, which allow the user to view te data, but not edit it. Users can request different layers, and sometimes make square cutouts, but these limit themselves to just selection queries. Polygons are often delivered uncut. (... there are many more examples ...)

new developments in Client Side web applications now make it possible to do complex geometric processes, such as boolean intersections & unions, projection, edits in topology, etc, client side from a web browser. This could enable a 

we propose the creation of an environment

> improving (...) in web applications by utilizing Rust & WebAssembly





## Why rust 
- Fast 
- Save & 'idiot proof'
- compiles very well into WebAssembly, better than C++

## Why WebAssembly 
- cross platform: makes core run anywhere, even in web browsers
