Geon is a 3D engine that i built from scratch, written in typescript, with a focus on seamless integration between visuals & computational geometry. I created it to satisfy a variety of purposes:
- To learn how to generate & visualize point clouds & meshes efficiently (

)
- As a demo for explaining mathematical concepts, to myself and others (https://josfeenstra.nl/demo/geon/#leastsquares)
- As a demo environment for complex data structures such as half edge meshes: (https://josfeenstra.nl/demo/geon/#sphericalone)

Besides the usual suspects like render abstractions, basic scene abstractions, data structures for meshes, some primitives, linear algebra,
