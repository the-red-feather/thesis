## notes 
- Very nice general introduction to wasm in general
- Guy Royse: WebAssembly works out of the box with rust, and is considered to have better support because of this 
- wasm doesn't know what a string is -> needs a lot of bindings 
- wasm cant talk directly to the DOM

## notes 
- Browsers & Docker & Cloud computing become the same thing with wasm. 
- Write once, run anywhere
  -> old slogan for Java, now becomes true of wasm
  -> write once, run **everywhere** -> deploy your code in 1000x servers, parallel computing
  -> analogue to SDI: "Collect once, use multiple times"
