What these papers mean for my direction

MAIN
- Expand FAIR data paradigm to FAIR processing of data.
  - Ways of data processing should be Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Re-usable
    - address **accessibility** by making flowchart app.
    - address **findability** by making this a web-app
    - address **interoperability** by making sure all geo-processing can be done on three locations: 
      - locally: rust cli 
      - client: wasm 
      - server: wasm  (wont be tested / expanded upon, but client implementation implies that the same can be used on a server)
    - improve **re-usability** by making it incredibly easy to find and add plugins


STANDARDIZATION & INTEROPERABILITY
- Preserve data models & processes in client & server & local.
- Same standard can be applied everywhere and anywhere
- Of every process we do, we can expect the same outcome in all three of these environments.
