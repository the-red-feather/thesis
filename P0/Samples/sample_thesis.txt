Geometry processing & modelling client side on the web

In recent years, the demand for parametric design modelling has increased. Where these technologies fail to meet demands, however, is on the level of accessibility and interactivity. Parametric designs are often difficult to publish, because the models have close ties to certain software packages.  

This issue is mirrored by web maps, which allow the user to view te data, but not edit it. Users can request different layers, and sometimes make square cutouts, but these limit themselves to just selection queries.

new developments in Client Side webapplications now make it possible to do complex geometric processes, such as boolean intersections & unions, projection, edits in topology, etc, client side from a web browser. This could enable a
