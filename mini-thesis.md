# Geofront

## intro
geodata computation is important
geodata computation is difficult
L Performance intensive: (Big data, O(n^2) problems)
L Heterogenous data (type, quality, scale, criteria, crs)
L Complex (geometric) operations (linalg, bundle adjustment, procedural modelling) 

All of this makes geodata un-ergonomic
A central goal of geomatics research: make geodata processing as ergonomic as possible

two ways of making it more ergonomic have been researched / are being researched 

#### vpl-based geoprocessing
...

#### browser based geoprocessing 
...

#### Problem 
Both these fields are unresolved, many open ended questions remain.
These two fields have not been combined yet.
A combination might solve some of these individual open-ended questions.

#### main research objective: 
figure out how vpl & bbg combined can aid geoprocessing.
- By exploring inhibitions of geo-web-vpl and finding fixes for:
  - performance 
  - availability of powerful libraries
  - usefulness of available powerful libraries ( can I use my own data? can i use a WMS?)
- By exploring possibilities
  - How to take advantage of the medium?
