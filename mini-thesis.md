# Geofront


#### Problem 
Both these fields are unresolved, many open ended questions remain.
These two fields have not been combined yet.
A combination might solve some of these individual open-ended questions.

#### main research objective: 
Explore how well geocomputation could be combined with a web-based visual programming interface. 
- By exploring inhibitions of a 'geo-web-vpl' and finding fixes for:
  - performance 
  - availability of powerful libraries
  - usefulness of available powerful libraries ( can I use my own data? can i use a WMS?)
- By exploring possibilities
  - How to take advantage of the medium?
