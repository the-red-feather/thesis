<p>In this thesis the performance of polyline simplification in web browsers is evaluated.<br>Based on the JavaScript library Simplify.js a WebAssembly solution is built to increase<br>performance. The solutions implement the Douglas-Peucker polyline simplification algo-<br>rithm with optional radial distance preprocessing. The format for polylines that Sim-<br>plify.js expects differs from the representation used in major geodata formats. This dis-<br>crepancy is obvious in another JavaScript library, Turf.js, where it is overcome by format<br>transformations on each call. A slight variant of Simplify.js is proposed in this thesis<br>that can operate directly on the format used in GeoJSON and TopoJSON. The three<br>approaches, Simplify.js, Simplify.js variant and Simplify.wasm are compared across differ-<br>ent browsers by creating a web page, that gathers various benchmarking metrics. It is<br>concluded that WebAssembly performance alone supersedes JavaScript performance. A<br>drop-in replacement that includes memory management however bears overhead that can<br>outweigh the performance gain. To fully utilize WebAssembly performance more effort<br>regarding memory management is brought to web development. It is shown that the<br>method used by Turf.js is unfavorable in most cases. Merely one browser shows a perfor-<br>mance gain under special circumstances. In the other browsers the use of the Simplify.js<br>variant is preferable.</p></div></div></body></html>
