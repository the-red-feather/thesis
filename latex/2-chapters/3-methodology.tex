\chapter{Methodology}
This chapter outlines the methodology of this study. 
The method can be subdivided into four steps:

\begin{enumerate}[(1)]
  \item Define the criteria a web-based geo-vpl needs to meet up to.
  \item Develop the vpl according to these criteria.
  \item Create multiple demo GIS applications using this vpl, each to test a criterium.
  \item Based on these demo's, access to which extend the criteria are met.  
\end{enumerate}

This process is cyclical.
If the vpl scores significantly low on some criterium, the functionality of the vpl might need to be altered, after which the demo use-case applications must be  reassessed. 


\section{Criteria / Features}

\emph{Q: Which features are required for a 'usable' VPL intended for geo-computation?}

The success of this study is measured by assessing to what extend the geo-web-vpl adheres to its requirements. 
These requirements are in turn based upon related works within VPL research, as well as web GIS studies. 
This section outlines these requirements, and explains why they are used. 
Additionally, certain use-cases are envisioned as proxies of these requirements, to test certain requirements in a realistic scenario.

<<<<<<< Updated upstream
\subsection*{Criterium A: Interactivity}
\begin{lstlisting}
  Interactivity is the defining factor of the vpl. 
  a list of standard VPL features & application features required as a base-line:  
- Users must be able to construct a script by visual means.
- Dataflow Modelling
- Dragging and dropping is a ui which

(geo-vpl features:)
- read data from user-submitted files
- write data to files, downloadable by the user  
- debug / inspect data in a 3D viewer
- draw geometry in a 3D viewer

\end{lstlisting}


% The entire application runs client-side in a browser, and uses a visual programming language as its primary \ac{gui}.
% The main goal and feature of geofront is to take existing low level geo-computation libraries, and to make these interactively usable on the web. 
% These libraries include a limited set of CGAL operations, complied from C++, and various geo-computation algorithms such as Startin, written in Rust. 
% Being a visual programming language, GeoFront can be used to interactively alter the geodata pipeline. 
% In between products can quickly be inspected using a 3D viewer.

% We test how well contemporary web technologies support such an application, as well as judge aspects such as accessibility \& performance of said application. We also judge if this type of application is indeed beneficial and usable as a scripting / demo environment.  

% These features could all be implemented by normal means ( buttons, panels, sliders ) -->

% CHOICE: do something in-between python bindings, and a full fletched end-user application. 
% Ergo: Visual programming

% For input, the environment offers \ac{wms} and \ac{wfs} support, as well as ways for users to load locally stored geodata. Parameters can be specified using various ui components, such as sliders. 
% For output, the environment can be used to either save data to the user's local machine, or to visualize the results within the geofront application using a WebGL based viewport.

% Where ModelLab is build on top of recent improvements to the accessability of satellite imagery, GeoFront is build in anticipation to a similar development for point cloud datasets with the introduction of COPC.  The focus of Geofront is therefore on point cloud processing, and point-cloud based modelling, such as Digital Terrain Models (DTM). 



% NOTE: these are the '1 or 2 major contributions, besides making a web-geo-vpl'
\subsection*{Criterium B: Extendability}
\begin{lstlisting}
REASON: 
  - VPL: Important take away from meta-analysis: extendability
  - WEB: Geoweb: FAIR principles -> fair geoprocessing

CRITERIA
  - ease of creating and using plugins 
  - ease of using existing geo-libraries 
  - written in non-js languages

  The quality of plugin creation and utilization
The extend in which existing, non-js, industry-standard libraries can be used

\end{lstlisting}



\subsection*{Criterium C: Publicability (the ability to publish / operationalize) } 
\begin{lstlisting}

REASON: 
 - VPL: application life-cycle is important: how to publish & use applications created using vpl's
 - WEB: cloud-native geoprocessing: requires server-side / cloud based
   geo-computation interoperability: 
   meaning the scripts must be able to be used without any of the 
   interactivity features.

CRITERIA:
 - ease of sharing apps as a visual program
 - ease of compiling and running the app headless
\end{lstlisting}


% \begin{lstlisting}

% Methodology: define the scope, extend, and how of the study 

% why these sub questions? How will the sub-questions be answered?
% - Findable: THE WEB-APP INTRODUCTION / CLIENT-SIDE GEOPROCESSING
% - Accessible: THE FIRST PART OF THE VPL INTRODUCTION -> VPL advantages
% - Interoperable: THE WEBASSEMBLY INTRODUCTION / CONTAINERIZATION 
% - Re-usable: THE SECOND PART OF THE VPL INTRODUCTION -> VPL's have shortcomings


% \end{lstlisting}


% As such, the study first describes the design and implementation of GeoFront, and then evaluates the tool to various geo-computation use cases.
% The advantages and disadvantages of browser based geo-computation, compared to native or server-side geo-computation, are examined in several scenario's. 
% Both quantitative indicators, like loading and runtime performance, as well as qualitative indicators, like the fitness for an intended use-case, are measured in each of these cases.

\section{Evaluation}
 



\section{Use Cases}

\emph{Q: Usage: Who benefits from a web-geo-vpl? }

A web-based visual programming language for geo-computation as described by this study does not exist yet. 
This requires us to be clear about its intended use-case. 
However, because of this same novelty, a singular, definitive use-case can not be given.
To solve this problem, this study names four possible use-cases.  
These cases are not mutually exclusive, but will be judged separately, based on specific criteria 
During assessment, we will use these four profiles and accompanying criteria to judge how well the geo-web-vpl meets up this use-case.

\subsection*{Case 1: Educational Sandbox}

"
insight within these processes are vital for communication, voor 'overdracht' 
the 'jonathan blow educational argument' 
"



- This use-case can be fully realized within the current state of geofront
- "Geoprocessing for kids"
- "What is a delaunay triangulation?" 
- "Let people play / experience / traverse a nef polyhedron"
- Using something helps with understanding

\subsubsection*{Criteria}
Used primairly as a test for \textbf{Criterium A}.


\subsection*{Case 2: Web Demo Environment}
% # A: 1. Geofront as a geoprocessing / analysis demo tool.
% - Frame Geofront as an expanded version of https://validator.cityjson.org/ this. 
%   - [this](https://validator.cityjson.org/) (a wasm web demo) + jsfiddle 
%   - Use rust, web, and c++ tools side by side, hand in hand

- Reproducibility toolkit:
- Workflow: 
  - Load your own code from a CDN
  - Build a demo setup around it
  - load a custom graph from a public json file
  - share a url pointing to this json (which contains the CDN address)
- You can now share a rust / C++ program as a fully usable web demo,   
  and analyze its performance using different datasets, test parameters, etc. 
- interdisciplinary exchange of ideas
- MISSING FEATURE: dependency list inside of the graph.json save file

% Within the field of geo-informatics, we want to share our end-results. 
% - Usually on git, but this has limitations:
%     - Not everybody can immediately use it ( unfamiliar language / build system),
%     - Even people who can understand, often wont go through the trouble.  
%     - "Python bindings" -> half-solves the problem, but still hard to publish to a general audience. 

% This was the exact reason for developing https://validator.cityjson.org/. This solved the issue of publication. Why? 
% - Extremely findable, usable, accessible
%   - Cross-platform
%   - No install 
%   - first point of contact is precisely where you can use it
%   - You can send a link not to a download page, but to the application itself
%   - Great for communication: blogs with embedded applications.
%   - Code sharing: you exactly know what to expect.

\subsubsection*{Criteria}
Used primairly as a test for \textbf{Criterium B}.
show that criteria B can be used to strip down the environment to purely that which needs to be demonstrated.

\subsection*{Case 3: End User Geoprocessing Environment}
- Lightweight FME, but open source \& on the web.
- The tool in itself can be regarded as an end-user application:
  - Load file, do something with the file, download resulting file
  - REQUIRES WAY MORE SUPPORTING LIBRARIES AND TOOLS
- Flowcharts can be exchanged by means of url's.
- Future work: export flowchart to a process which can be run natively or server side.
  

\subsubsection*{Criteria}
Used primairly as a test for \textbf{Criterium C}.


\subsection*{Case 4: Rapid-Prototyping Environment}
\begin{lstlisting}
- Web geoflow
- To be used within a regular software development process.
- Ravi's GeoFlow, but on the web
- Meant to visually debug a certain process, after which this process can be 'compiled' to a normal cli tool.


  WHY: 
  - all three the previous use-cases combined: demo, test, educate yourself
    on your own algorithms, then operationalize the code to use it in a 
    serious environment.  

  
\end{lstlisting}





% - CURRENTLY MISSING FEATURE: compile to native cli tool (node.js script)
% - REQUIRES WAY MORE SUPPORTING LIBRARIES AND TOOLS


\subsubsection*{Criteria}
A total test of \textbf{Criteria A, B and C}.

% ## Web Demo & Scripting environments

% we are not the first to recognize the suitability of the web for publishing demo's

% We see a lot of interactive web-demo's nowadays, and many of them are embedded within a type of "Demo Hosts":

% - Scripting environments in (Science) Communication:
%   - Jupyter Notebook 
%   - Observable
%   - JsFiddle
%   - Shadertoy
%   - Wapm

% - Scripting environments in Education: 
%   - TU Delft C++ course
%   - Udemy

% - Scripting environments in Tutorials: 
%   - Rust
%   - Lit

%   <!-- - (game-jam games)
%       - more save (no virus) -->

% <!-- We also see 

% - As accessible alternative to native
%   - Overleaf -> does not use webassembly, but a classic client-server architecture
%   - Google Earth -->

% All these applications lie on a crossroad between being an interactive demonstration of a certain result or phenomenon, 
% and an open invitation for the user to edit and use this result or phenomenon. 
% (CITE A STUDY PROVING HOW INTERACTION BENEFITS LEARNING), 
% so toying around is important.

% <!-- So it is save to say the web is suitable for these types of things. 
% But is the web also suitable for more? Can we use a web-based sandbox environment to -->


% we want to examine and edit the geodata flow, see for example, where these errors occur, try to get to that data, see if we can make hotfixes, etc. etc. 







% Under normal circumstances, Web applications within the field of geo-informatics are mostly used for the first and final stages of a common geodata process.  
% (
% If one wishes to retrieve geodata, web portals are used to discover the required datasets. After this, the OGC Web Services are often utilized to download and truly access this geodata. 

% This geodata is then processed locally, using QGIS, ArcGIS, command line tools, or any other 

% and at the end Tools like Leaflet and Celcium have been created to visualize the earth in both 2D and 3D , and tools like d3.js can produce interactive graphs to supplement these web pages. 

% There is, however, more to the web than just visualization. Due to 
% )
% This thesis asks the question if the web could do more than just visualization. 

% By creating the use-case application GeoFront, we ask the question if a modern web browser, and the current state of the client-side web technologies are capable of facilitating  


% ## Motivation
% Under normal circumstances, Web applications within the field of geo-informatics are mostly used for the first and final stages of a common geodata process: Retrieval and visualization. 
% The processing stages in-between are almost always performed on the desktop using environments like QGIS or ArcGIS, or by writing and using CLI tools. 

% <!-- At the same time, a need arrises -->

% ## This Study

% This thesis explores if these in-between processing steps could also be performed within a web application.  
% This way, geodata processing applications could profit from the ease of accessibility and maintainability granted by the web as a platform.  

% <!-- More Why's: 
% - making the geoweb more feature-rich
% - allowing quick demonstration (wapm)
% - allowing easy access (overleaf)


%  -->

% (similar to how overleaf is more accessible than desktop latex installation & usage)

% We ask ourselves if the current state of client-side web technologies are capable of facilitating multiple steps of geodata conversion, and what such an application would look like. 

% To concretize this question, this study covers the design and creation a use-case application titled "Geofront". 

% By designing and creating this environment, the study seeks to gain valuable insights in the current state of client-side core web technologies / javascript std, and how well this facilitates various geoprocessing operations.
