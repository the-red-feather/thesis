In this article we described the design and functionality of Geofront, A web-based ...



% (I must figure out how to frame this thesis more compactly. I must focus on a smaller aspect of geofront than the totality of it.)

% By creating geofront, this thesis was able to discover .............

% - advantages: 
%   - The web **is** able to facilitate a visual programming language.
%     - does indeed make excellent use of accessibility & interactivity aspect
%   - reasonable performance 
%     (- great considering the platform)

% - disadvantages: 
%   - all in-between data must be stored in memory if it is to be inspected.
%     - Can't make use of 'writing files', so that something can be removed from memory 
%     - BUT, even when using emscripten, you are still caching all sorts of things

%   - The web is able to be used for geoprocessing, albeit with some caveats
%     - Less control and precision
%     - TypedArrays,
%     - Geometric predicates 
%     - Rounding
%     - ETC.

%   - Many of these things can be fixed with webassembly, but webassembly itself has other shortcomings
%     - Differences between Rust & C++

%  - Notes:

%    - would not be possible without these modern web features
%     - Web Assembly 
%     - Typed Array's 
%     - Web Workers
%     - Web Components,
%     - 2D Canvas API
%     - Web GL

% - ability to share is a true enhancement
