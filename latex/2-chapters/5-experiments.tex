% \section{Use Case: Educational Sandbox}
% \begin{lstlisting}
% WHAT: 
%  - show the behaviour of a simple ransac algorithm, fitting a plane through 
%    a point cloud
%  - show it beharivourly: show in-between steps
%  - make parameters ajustable (number of high scores, minimum high score, 
%    number of tries, etc.)
%  - add least squares adjustment, and compare.

% SIMILAR EXAMPLES: 
%  - the geometric predicates explanation 
%  (https://observablehq.com/@mourner/non-robust-arithmetic-as-art)
%  - 

% ASSESS ON: 
%  - educational value
%  - ease of usage (the promise of **Criterium A**)
 
% ASSESSMENT (hypothesis): 
%  + indeed very insightful for analying the behaviour 
%    and operation of certain 
%    algorithms & parameters. Not many applications can show 
%    this level of insight. 
%  + feature B can be used to strip the tool down 
%    to the bare minimum,   helping 
%    with not overwhelming the user with features

%  - This VPL is not easy to operate. 
%    It remains difficult to communicate what needs to 
%    be done, how things work. This is not an expert tool, 
%    but also not a beginners' tool.
%  - No built-in tutorialization
%  - hard to discover the code underneath, 
%    obfuscating the link between process and code.

% \section{Use Case: Web Demo Environment}
% \begin{lstlisting}
%     WHAT:
%      - Show the startin delaunay triangulator
%      - Accept user-submitted Laz files as input
%        - filter the ground
%      - Accept a randomly generated point cloud based on perlin noise.
%      - Visualize the generated mesh, and make it available for download

%     EXAMPLES: 
%      - hugo's demo
    
%      ASSESS ON:
%      - **Criterium B**: extendability: 
%        - how does foreign and native codebases interact? 
%      - clarity
%      - reproducibility
%      - performance
%      - scope (raster / vector / 2D / 3D)

%     JUDGEMENTS (hypothesis): 
%      + Clarity is fine
%      + Reproducability is 
%      + Performance is decent

%      ~ clarity is fine, vpl allows users to 'play around' and try
%        different configurations, even run their own data through the
%        demonstrated functions

%      - Application is less suited for 2D 
    
% \end{lstlisting}


% \section{Use Case: Geoprocessing Environment}%%%%%%%%%%% SECTION
% \begin{lstlisting}

%     WHAT:
%       - Query an area of a point cloud with a polygon
%       - turn that area of points into a triangulation
%       - turn triangulation into isocurves
%       - save this as a geojson
%       - turn this whole thing into a function, which takes a PC, 
%         polygon and isocurve range, and spits out the geojson
%       - share this using a link
%       - turn this into an app?
%       - turn this into a script?

%     EXAMPLES: 
%      - 

%      ASSESS ON:
%      - **Criterium C**: Publicability:
%        - the ability to operationalize the application 
%        - can it be used by end-users? clarity? too much clutter

%     JUDGEMENTS (hypothesis): 
%       ~ sharing by link is possible, but for end-user usage, 
%         its very cluttered 
%       ~ compiling to js only partially works
%       ~ compiling into an app is not possible, but 
%         since everything runs client-side, it could be implemented.
