% ### Vector
% _Vector data retrieval, transformation, visualization_

% ### Raster 
% _Raster data retrieval, transformation, visualization_

% ### 6. Experiments 
% _Performance benchmark between rust-wasm / cpp-wasm / cgal-cpp-wasm / js / cli usage_

% ## Final 
% _Answer research questions ????_


\section{ Misc Experiments }

\subsection{ geojson }
-> could work, more structure needed

\subsection{ Web Mapping Service }
-> could work, must be captured in component
-> streaming question

\subsection{ Open Street Map }
-> could be hooked up to the geojson viewer

\section{ Case Studies } 
- If geofront in its current form is beneficial,
  - Why, Why not?
- If geofront COULD be useful

\subsection{Case Study on Use Case 1}%%%%%%%%%%% SECTION
- Judge on accessibility
- Judge on educational value

...

\subsection{Case Study on Use Case 2}%%%%%%%%%%% SECTION
- Judge on performance
- Judge on data size
