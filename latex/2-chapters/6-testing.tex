\label{chap:testing}

In this chapter the various software implementations and design choices made in \refchap{chap:implementation} are used and tested on various aspects. 
This is done to gather the data needed to answer the second, third and fourth research question. 
It consists of the sections \refsec{sec:testing:compilation} and \refsec{sec:testing:usability}.


\section{Plugin Compilation Tests}
\label{sec:testing:compilation}

\subsection{Rust: minimal plugin}
The compilation of a minimum Rust plugin, exposing a function, a class, and a method was successful. 
% APPENDIX?
\reffig{fig:min-rust-plugin-code:1} Shows the source code of this plugin. 
The 'wasm-bindgen' library allows functions and classes to be annotated as 'bound to javascript'. 
This simplifies the compilation process to WebAssembly greatly. 
It also clearly states errors if a property or class are incompatible to be exposed. 

This library was compiled to WebAssembly and javascript using 'wasm-pack'. 
This produces multiple artifacts, showcased in \reffig{fig:rust-plugin:compilation-results}. 
This figure also showcases how wasm-pack wraps the functionality: 
The \m{point\_distance} function exposed by the wasm file is wrapped by the javascript file, converting it to look like a regular javascript class.

To check if the result is valid, a small html demo was created to load and use the library (see \reffig{fig:min-rust-plugin-code:2}).
Note how the JavaScript library wrapping the wasm file looks and works almost like a normal javascript library, the only difference being a 'init' function, which is required to be run before using the library, and the need to free the memory of used object with the \m{free\(\)} method.

\end{figure}

To load this project into Geofront, a reference to the path of the compilation artifacts must be specified within the Geofront GUI, shown in \reffig{fig:min-rust-plugin-import}.
A local path was used for convenience, instead of publishing this demo to npm, and accessing it via a \ac{CDN}.

\reffig{fig:rust-plugin-on-canvas:1} shows how all functions in this demo are loaded correctly, and \reffig{fig:rust-plugin-on-canvas:2} shows that the functions indeed work as expected to create two Graphs. 
Note how the parameter names and Types are also loaded, indicated by the names visualized at the input and output of the nodes.
This is thanks to the 'd.ts' file of \reffig{fig:rust-plugin:compilation-results}.

All in all, no problems were encountered.

\subsection{Rust: Startin plugin}

Compilation of the \m{Startin} library was also successful. 
Startin already offered a wasm-ready library, this could directly be loaded into Geofront. 
However, the API exposed by this library used a non-functional style, making it hard to properly use the library on a VPL canvas. 
This is why a custom plugin library still had to be created, in which functions like '\m{new\_from\_vec}' were added to support functional usage. 

Other than that, all steps performed by the minimal Rust plugin could be made with this project as well, as shown in \reffig{fig:startin-plugin}. 
This also showcases the usage of the 'Renderable' bindings. 
This way, a variable of type 'Triangulation' can be viewed in 3D by clicking on it.

\begin{note}
  
  HOWEVER 
  - existing geo-libs: 
    - file IO focussed, (because of streaming \& big data)
    - templates
  
  **C++ -> wasm is difficult**
  
  - requires a lot of trivia knowledge. 
    - Often, many subdependencies need to be traversed, and makefiles need to be manually edited. 
    - This cannot be done often, or easely. 
  - Documentation?
  - Libraries cannot be called. emscripten prefers a cli-type interface, and prefers you to write all the operations you wish to publish as separate command line applications.

\subsection{Assessment}

This section offers an analysis on the usability of Geofront, according to the framework described by \cite[]{green_usability_1996}.

\subsubsection*{Abstraction gradient: What are the minimum and maximum levels of abstraction? Can fragments be encapsulated?}

Geofront was meant to support encapsulation. 
The need for re-using parts of a script as components / functions was deemed more important than the benefits of having no abstraction hierarchy (what you see is what you get).
An early prototype of Geofront did allow for encapsulation, by taking a subset of a Geofront script, and compiling it to a javascript subset. This could then be loaded by the library loader. 
However, the addition of special types of nodes, and features like iteration, invalidated the \m{geofront -> js} translator.
The translation is still possible, just not implemented.  
As such, if a user desires re-usable components and a lower abstraction level, they will need to write a Geofront library.

% \textbf{Suggestion for improvement:} re-implemented the 'compile to js' procedure.s
% (image of abstracting away a javascript subset)

\subsubsection*{Closeness of mapping: What 'programming games' need to be learned?}

Mapping a problem to a geofront script is intuitive for the most part.
Think of the operations needed to solve a problem, 
find the right libraries and nodes representing these operations,
and connect these nodes according to type. 
However, this mapping of problem and solution is hindered by the fact that Geofront needed to support iteration. 

(image of iteration problem)



\subsubsection*{Consistency: When some of the language has been learnt, how much of the rest can be inferred?}

\cite[]{green_usability_1996} notes on the difficulty of defining 'consistency' in language design, and chose to define it as a form of 'guessability'.

Geofront has introduced certain symbolic distinctions between graphical entities to aid this predictability. 
The biggest is the distinction between \m{operation} and \m{widget} components: 
operations are pure functions with inputs and outputs. 
widgets represent some 'outside world' interaction, like an input value, a file, or a web service. 
This way, 'special behavior' is isolated to widgets, making the rest of the script more predictable. 

In practice, certain inconsistencies within Geofront arise due to the open nature of the plugin system. 
the consistency of geofront is mitigated by a library with a very different notion of naming, or if the library chooses unusual input or output patterns. 
For example, a euclidean, 3D coordinate can be specified as a \m{Vector3} object, a struct, an array of three numbers, or three different x, y, z input parameters.
Then again, it is unclear if inconsistencies between the api's of a language's libraries are to be contributed to the inconsistency of the language as a whole. 

\textbf{Suggestion for improvement:} Stabilize the api of the Geofront Standard Library.



\subsubsection*{Diffuseness: How many symbols or graphic entities are required to express a meaning?}

Geofront periodically suffers from the same 'Diffuseness' problems \cite[]{green_usability_1996} adheres to vpls general. 
That is, sometimes a surprising number of 'graphical entities' / nodes are required to represent a simple statement.  
This is apparent when representing mathematical calculations. 

\begin{note}
  - the flowchart can only represent linear processes. Many geoprocessing algorithms are iterative and make use of conditionals. These cannot easily be expressed in a DAG VPL. As such, these processes must happen within the context of a function, within a 'computational node'  
\end{note}


(image of complex / simple mathematical calcluation in javascript and in geofront)

\textbf{Suggestion for improvement:} These situations could be prevented by allowing scriptable components. 

\subsubsection*{Error- proneness: Does the design of the notation induce 'careless mistakes'?}

There are some errors the user can make  in Geofront that will not be immediately obvious. 
The biggest one is that there are no systems in place preventing large calculations. 
These might freeze up the application. 

To prevent this, the geofront interpreter should have been implemented to run on a separate thread, using a web worker. 
Besides this, in general, many systems are in place preventing errors, such as the type-safety used throughout geofront.
Also, by disallowing cyclical graphs, users cannot create infinite loops accidentally.

\subsubsection*{Hard mental operations: Are there places where the user needs to resort to fingers or pencilled annotation to keep track of what's happening?}

Geofront is developed specifically to prevent "Hard mental operations".
Following the dataflow paradigm explained in \refsec{sec:background:dataflow}, geofront chose to disallows cyclical patterns. 
This greatly reduces the complexity of possible graph configurations, and also causes all in-between results to be immutable or 'final'.
By then allowing these results to be inspected, and allowing the graph to be easily reconfigured, Geofront allows a workflow rooted in experimentation and 'play'.
Users do not need to 'keep track' or 'guess' how things work.
Instead, they can simply experience the behavior, and adjust the behavior until satisfied. 



\subsubsection*{Hidden dependencies: Is every dependency overtly indicated in both directions? Is the indication perceptual or only symbolic?}

The dimension of 'hidden dependencies' is another way the dataflow-paradigm is advantageous. 
The pure functions of a diagram-based vpl like Geofront make the language in general consistent and predictable.
However, there are two exceptions to this rule:
First, the \m{widget} nodes are allowed to produce side-effects, such as opening a window, asking for an input, making a web request, etc. 
These are required to provide geofront with interactive inputs and outputs.
The distinction between \m{widgets} and \m{}

And second, the pureness of functions can only be maintained if all Geofront libraries also exclusively use pure functions. 
There is no fail-safe in place to prevent the usage of a library containing functions with many side-effects. 

\subsubsection*{Premature commitment: Do programmers have to make decisions before they have the information they need?}

In general, Geofront requires almost no premature commitment. 
Or, rather, the level of premature commitment is in line with textual programming languages, in the sense that a user is always somewhat committed to the structure they themselves build. 

One practical way in which Geofront exceeds in this dimension of premature commitment, is that the application does not require a restart upon loading a new library. 
Users can add or remove libraries "on the fly". 
This is unlike any vpl studied at \refsec{sec:related-geovpl} or \refsec{sec:related-webvpl}.

One particular type of commitment users must be aware off, however, is the commitment to using a \ac{VPL} like Geofront. 
Therefore, 


\subsubsection*{Progressive evaluation: Can a partially-complete program be executed to obtain feedback on 'How am I doing'?}

Yes. 
As explained at the answer for the dimension of 'Hard mental operations', this is a core aspect in how Geofront achieves its interactivity and debugability, together with its ability to inspect parameters. 

(Image: Show example)

\subsubsection*{Role- expressiveness: Can the reader see how each component of a program relates to the whole?}

as the authors of \cite[]{green_usability_1996} write: "The dimension of role-expressiveness is intended to describe how easy it is to answer the question 'what is this bit for?'"

sizeable phenomenon

grootste boosdoener: looping is now a simple boolean toggle within a component. 
This makes it very non-explicit, 

This leads to another problem: the problem of declarative iterations within a vpl. 


\subsubsection*{Secondary notation: Can programmers use layout, color, other cues to convey extra meaning, above and beyond the 'official' semantics of the language?}

No, Geofront does not offer annotations in its current state, besides the way the nodes are configured on the canvas.  
Geofront does provide visual indicators for types, and for if a cable / variable represents a single item, or a list of items.

\textbf{Suggestion for improvement:} Provide a way to annotate: create groups, write comments, etc. 
\textbf{Suggestion for improvement:} Type colors would also be nice.

\subsubsection*{Viscosity: How much effort is required to perform a single change?}

Despite these efforts, the 'mouse intensive' interface of vpls like Geofront continues to be a hinder for viscosity.
Certain situations require excessive mouse interaction, like substituting a function with another function, but keeping all inputs the same.
In text, this would be as simple as a non-symbolic renaming of the called function.
In geofront, this requires a lot of reconfiguration of cables. 

\textbf{Suggestion for improvement:} Viscosity could be improved by creating special actions in the editor to perform these types of manipulations.  
%  - select multiple inputs, select multiple outputs: connect by height.
% rename node


\subsubsection*{Visibility: Is every part of the code simultaneously visible (assuming a large enough display), or it it at least possible to juxtapose any two parts side-by-side at will? If the code is dispersed, is it at least possible to know in what order to read it?}

All parts of the code are simultaneously visible. 
As the question implies, by not making the code dispersed,
