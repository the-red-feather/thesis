\chapter*{Abstract}
Geocomputation is a cornerstone of GIS \& modern mapping needs.
While major advancements during the last 20 years have been achieved, writing a geocomputational pipeline remains a complex, non-trivial exercise. 
Performing geocomputations by utilizing a visual programming language (VPL) within a web browser is a novel development which seeks to simplify this process, allowing more people to write pipelines more successfully.
% It would, in theory, allow end-users to author geocomputation pipelines, without the need of a software development background, and without the need to install software.
% utilizing a dataflow model.
% This model is the standard within VPLs dealing with geometry processing, and contains many advantages in terms of performance and reliability.

In this context, the portability of existing geocomputation libraries is a common problem.
This is often addressed by maintaining duplicate JavaScript alternatives to libraries such as GDAL, PROJ, and GEOS, complicating innovation.  

The study poses that this problem can only be overcome if native geocomputation libraries are able to be properly \emph{compiled}, \emph{loaded}, \emph{utilized} in a browser-based dataflow-VPL format.
Discovering if and how this can be done is the central question of this study. 
% This study seeks to improve the state of web-based geocomputation VPLs 
% by discovering if the library portability problem can be overcome, and if so, how.

This question is answered by testing a possible solution.
A proof of concept web-based VPL is designed, implemented and evaluated, which makes use of a novel plugin system, as well as a directed, acyclic graph-based data model \& interface.

Using this proof of concept, the study was able to demonstrate that the web platform was sufficiently capable of \emph{representing} a VPL capable of constructing geocomputation pipelines.
The functional programming-properties of this dataflow VPL also makes geo-libraries sufficiently \emph{usable}, albeit with some well-known caveats of dataflow-VPLs, like the representation of conditionals and iteration. 

The current methods of \emph{compiling} existing C++ geocomputation libraries to the web turned out to be insufficient for the purposes of this study.  
This is due to the Emscripten compiler's focus on compiling full C++ applications instead of separate libraries.
Despite this, the study wÃ¡s able to demonstrate how a novel method can be used to sufficiently \emph{compile} and \emph{load} a Rust-library for usage in the VPL.
While not many contemporary geocomputation libraries are written in Rust, the study offers this method to either offer emscripten contributors a blueprint of a desired workflow, or to offer geocomputation library contributors a powerful use-case for the Rust language. 

All in all, this means that either if the Rust ecosystem gains more mature geocomputation libraries, or if Emscripten's capabilities improve, then the code portability problem \& dataflow problem of existing web-based geocomputation VPLS can be solved.

    Stelios Draft Comments
    ======================
    
    In general, I think it's going well. I think the intro is fine, although it can be improved. I like the conclusions quite a lot, tbh. You are giving proper and interesting answers to the raised questions. The rest is a bit of a very rough draft, as I see. So, some specific points:
    
    TODO: Tone down stuff
    -  It seems like you have placed several bits here and there that seem like either introduction or conclusions. I feel your enthusiasm and excitement in your writing, but I think you are bringing questions and answers in places were people would normally just expect a simple narrative of what you did and what are the results.
    
    TODO: Write 6.2
    -  Speaking of results, we are missing the experiments so please put this at your first priority. This is because it feels like you promise things that you do not deliver.
    
    TODO: Find & Replace
    -  In general, you are using some very bold statements and informal expressions. The latter is kinda okay, but the first one is very dangerous. I've noticed words like "crucial", "by far" or "impressive" which seem very biased and subjective, so better be avoided. You can still use them here and there (mostly in the conclusions), but I think you use them way  too much (again, I can see your enthusiasm).
    
    TODO: Find & Replace 
    -  Minor thing, but I think you have confused \citet with \citep. The first one is used when the citation is part of the sentence and the latter when it's at the end of a sentence (or in a parenthesis, anyway).

% Geodata computation is important.

% Geodata computation is difficult.

% geo-web-vpls could help, but have seen little research

% This study: design, implement, analyze a new prototype geo-web-vpl. 

% Design-> utilize existing, native libraries written in C++ \& Rust on the web, in the format of a vpl.

% results -> it works.

%  - Performance intensive: (Big data, O(n^2) problems) 
%  - Heterogenous data (type, quality, scale, criteria, crs) 
%  - Complex (geometric) operations (linalg, bundle adjustment, procedural modelling) 
% \end{note}

% All of this makes the process of geocomputation difficult. 

% two ways of improving the process are actively being researched: Geocomputation by visual programming, and Geocomputation in web browsers.
% This study seeks to combine the advantages of both these approaches by 



% This thesis presents GeoFront, a web-based visual programming language, similar to Grasshopper \& FME. 
% With GeoFront, geoprocessing \& computational design flowcharts can be viewed, run, and shared using the web.  
% The full flowchart runs client-side in a browser, and both end results and intermediate products can be inspected in a 3D viewer.

% GeoFront offers several functionalities such as the parametric creation of 2D and 3D primitives, triangulation, isocurve extraction, and more. 
% These functionalities can be expanded upon though a plugin system which utilizes the existing "Node Package Manager" infrastructure.
% Together with WebAssembly, this enables the utilization of industry standard geoprocessing libraries such as `CGAL`, `GDAL` and `PROJ`, and data parsing libraries such as `IFC.js` and `laz-rs`.

% Geofront has been created as an experiment to explore if visual, 
% browser-based geo-computation can make geo-computation in general more accessible. 
% The advantages and disadvantages of browser based geo-computation, compared to native or server-side geo-computation, are examined in several scenario's. 
% Both quantitative indicators, like loading and runtime performance, as well as qualitative indicators, like the fitness for an intended use-case, are measured in each of these cases.
% This study concludes that based on these measurements, browser-based geo-computation is not only possible, but fast, and an enabler of many promising use-cases, such as on-demand geodata processing apps, educational demo apps, and code sharing. However, extensive user-group testing is required before any definitive statements on accessibility and fitness for geo-computation can be made.

%   - Just meant to quickly try out some features.

% 2. Educational (ACTUAL)
%    - interactive educational tool
%    - (What does a delaunay triangulation look like? how does it behave? What happens if you lower the radius of inverse distance weighting ? )

% 3. Rapid-Prototyping (POSSIBLE)
%    - Setting up pipelines which can be consumed by cloud-based geoprocessing services. 
%    - Future work: export flowchart to a process which can be run natively or server side.

% 4. Publishing (POSSIBLE)
%    - Geotiff.io / ModelLab
%    - Web FME 
%    - Publish full web apps in and off themselves, making use of zero, one or multiple wasm-compiled libraries.  
%    - Future work: export to web-app (without flowchart)

% % CONCLUSION
% By creating geofront, this thesis was able to discover .............

% - The web is able to facilitate a visual proregramming language.

% - The web is able to be used for geoprocessing, albeit with some caveats
%   - TypedArrays,
%   - Geometric predicates 
%   - Rounding
%   - ETC.

% - Many of these things can be fixed with webassembly, but webassembly itself has other shortcomings
%   - Differences between Rust \& C++

% - reasonable performance 
%   (- great considering the platform)

% - would not be possible without these modern web features
%   - Web Assembly 
%   - Typed Array's 
%   - Web Workers
%   - Web Components,
%   - 2D Canvas API
%   - Web GL

% \todo{[JF]: I need to add more critical notes on promises of accessibility. Is a webapp truly accessible? Is a flowchart interactive, or does it hinder interactiveness? }

% We believe that such a web application can make geoprocessing more accessible to practitioners.

% 
% This empowers users to create small geoprocessing demo's, and share these 

% With geofront, geoprocessing libraries can be loaded and used interactively. Users are also able to create and share flowcharts.
