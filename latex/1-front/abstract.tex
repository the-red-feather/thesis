\chapter*{Abstract}
Geocomputation is a cornerstone of all GIS \& virtual mapping needs.
While major advancements during the last 20 years have been achieved, writing a geocomputational pipeline remains a complex, non-trivial exercise. 
Performing geocomputations by utilizing a visual programming language (VPL) within a web browser is a novel development which seeks to simplify this process.
% It would, in theory, allow end-users to author geocomputation pipelines, without the need of a software development background, and without the need to install software.

In this context, the portability of existing geocomputation libraries is a common problem.
This is often addressed by maintaining duplicate JavaScript alternatives to libraries such as GDAL, PROJ, and GEOS, slowing down innovation.  
Secondly, no open source implementation exist yet of a web-based geocomputation VPL utilizing a dataflow model.
This model is the standard within VPlS dealing with geometry processing, and contains many advantages in terms of performance and features.

This study seeks to improve the state of web-based geocomputation VPLS by finding an answer to the code portability problem, and dataflow problem.
We seek to discover if these two problems can be overcome, and if so, how. 
The study poses that these two problems can only be overcome if native geocomputation libraries are able to be \emph{compiled}, \emph{loaded}, \emph{represented}, and \emph{utilized} in a browser-based dataflow-VPL format.
Discovering the extend to which this is possible is thus the central question of this study. 

This question is answered by testing a possible solution.
A proof of concept web-based VPL is designed, implemented and evaluated, which makes use of a novel plugin system, as well as an acyclic, graph-based data model \& interface.

Using this proof on concept, the study was able to demonstrate that the web platform was sufficiently capable of \emph{representing} a VPL capable of constructing geocomputation pipelines.
The functional programming-properties of this dataflow VPL also makes libraries sufficiently \emph{usable}, albeit with some well-known caveats of dataflow-VPLS, like the representation of conditionals and iteration. 

The current methods of \emph{compiling} existing C++ geocomputation libraries to the web turned out to be insufficient for the purposes of this study.  
This is due to the Emscripten compiler's focus on compiling full C++ applications instead of libraries.
Despite this, the study wÃ¡s able to demonstrate how a novel method can be used to sufficiently \emph{compile} and \emph{load} a Rust-library for usage in the VPL.
While not many contemporary geocomputation libraries are written in Rust, the study offers this method to either offer emscripten contributors a blueprint of a desired workflow, or to offer geocomputation library contributors a powerful use-case for the Rust language. 

All in all, this means that either if the Rust ecosystem gains more mature geocomputation libraries, or if Emscripten's capabilities improve, then the code portability problem \& dataflow problem of existing web-based geocomputation VPLS can be solved. 

% Geodata computation is important.

% Geodata computation is difficult.

% geo-web-vpls could help, but have seen little research

% This study: design, implement, analyze a new prototype geo-web-vpl. 

% Design-> utilize existing, native libraries written in C++ \& Rust on the web, in the format of a vpl.

% results -> it works.

% -> study shows that interplay between textual and visual programming is possible


% \begin{note}
%  - Performance intensive: (Big data, O(n^2) problems) 
%  - Heterogenous data (type, quality, scale, criteria, crs) 
%  - Complex (geometric) operations (linalg, bundle adjustment, procedural modelling) 
% \end{note}

% All of this makes the process of geocomputation difficult. 

% two ways of improving the process are actively being researched: Geocomputation by visual programming, and Geocomputation in web browsers.
% This study seeks to combine the advantages of both these approaches by 



% This thesis presents GeoFront, a web-based visual programming language, similar to Grasshopper \& FME. 
% With GeoFront, geoprocessing \& computational design flowcharts can be viewed, run, and shared using the web.  
% The full flowchart runs client-side in a browser, and both end results and intermediate products can be inspected in a 3D viewer.

% GeoFront offers several functionalities such as the parametric creation of 2D and 3D primitives, triangulation, isocurve extraction, and more. 
% These functionalities can be expanded upon though a plugin system which utilizes the existing "Node Package Manager" infrastructure.
% Together with WebAssembly, this enables the utilization of industry standard geoprocessing libraries such as `CGAL`, `GDAL` and `PROJ`, and data parsing libraries such as `IFC.js` and `laz-rs`.

% Geofront has been created as an experiment to explore if visual, 
% browser-based geo-computation can make geo-computation in general more accessible. 
% The advantages and disadvantages of browser based geo-computation, compared to native or server-side geo-computation, are examined in several scenario's. 
% Both quantitative indicators, like loading and runtime performance, as well as qualitative indicators, like the fitness for an intended use-case, are measured in each of these cases.
% This study concludes that based on these measurements, browser-based geo-computation is not only possible, but fast, and an enabler of many promising use-cases, such as on-demand geodata processing apps, educational demo apps, and code sharing. However, extensive user-group testing is required before any definitive statements on accessibility and fitness for geo-computation can be made.

% This thesis introduces GeoFront, a first step towards a web based, open source, geodata processing and visualization environment in an era of cloud-native geodata. 
% In this thesis, the motivation, requirements, technical aspects, and achieved functionality of geofront are covered. 

% GeoFront has been developed for two reasons. 

% Firstly, OGC Cloud native geospatial types, and specifically the Cloud Optimized Point Cloud, will create a need for equally accessible means to access, analyze, edit, and visualize this data. 
% Secondly, 

% % FUNCTIONALITY

% \emph{Accessibility} is achieved by compiling the geoprocessing libraries to webassembly, after which the tools can be run in a browser, client-side. 
% This mitigates the need for installment; 
% % As soon as the tool is found on the web, it can be used. 
% \emph{Interactivity} is achieved by making geofront a visual programming environment. 
% Functions are represented by blocks, and these can be chained together to form an interactively configurable geoprocessing pipeline. 
% In between products can be inspected and debugged using a 3D viewer. 
% % Special blocks such as sliders can be used to quickly try different values and parameters, and to 'sweetspot' certain settings.
% % INPUTS: OGC STANDARDS & FILE SYSTEM | OUTPUTS: DOWNLOAD

% % RESULT
% This study has successfully made a limited set of CGAL operations usable like this, as well as various rust-based geoprocessing algorithms such as Startin.
% % The performance is ..., \todo{"Do performance comparrisons"}

% % USE CASE
% GeoFront has multiple actual and possible use cases. 

% 1. Tryout (ACTUAL)
%    - A-la wapm WebAssembly Package Manager allows packages to be run from within the package-page itself. 
%   - Just meant to quickly try out some features.

% 2. Educational (ACTUAL)
%    - interactive educational tool
%    - (What does a delaunay triangulation look like? how does it behave? What happens if you lower the radius of inverse distance weighting ? )

% 3. Rapid-Prototyping (POSSIBLE)
%    - Setting up pipelines which can be consumed by cloud-based geoprocessing services. 
%    - Future work: export flowchart to a process which can be run natively or server side.

% 4. Publishing (POSSIBLE)
%    - Geotiff.io / ModelLab
%    - Web FME 
%    - Publish full web apps in and off themselves, making use of zero, one or multiple wasm-compiled libraries.  
%    - Future work: export to web-app (without flowchart)

% % CONCLUSION 



% % Safesoft's FME, but web based \& open source 

% % CONCLUSION
% By creating geofront, this thesis was able to discover .............

% - The web is able to facilitate a visual proregramming language.

%   - Rounding
%   - ETC.

% - Many of these things can be fixed with webassembly, but webassembly itself has other shortcomings
%   - Differences between Rust \& C++

% - reasonable performance 
%   (- great considering the platform)

% - would not be possible without these modern web features
%   - Web Assembly 
%   - Typed Array's 
%   - Web Workers
%   - Web Components,
%   - 2D Canvas API
%   - Web GL

% \todo{[JF]: I need to add more critical notes on promises of accessibility. Is a webapp truly accessible? Is a flowchart interactive, or does it hinder interactiveness? }

% We believe that such a web application can make geoprocessing more accessible to practitioners.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


% We introduce the \"Geofront\" application, which achieves this accessibility in two ways: 
% Firstly, geoprocessing libraries, written in either Rust or C++, are compiled to WebAssembly: binaries which can be run in any modern browser, client-side. This mitigates the need for any installation, and allows the software to be directly used as soon as a website is fully loaded. WebAssembly offers a performance comparable to native usage. Geofront accepts these binaries as plugins.

% Secondly, Geofront itself is set up as a web-based visual programming environment, complete with a 3D viewer and WMS, WFS \& WMTS support. Using these tools, users can interactively run these geoprocessing libraries with different datasets and parameters. Using visual programming, the user can chain and alter geoprocessing steps, visualize in-between products, and save \& load these workflows.



% 
% This empowers users to create small geoprocessing demo's, and share these 

% With geofront, geoprocessing libraries can be loaded and used interactively. Users are also able to create and share flowcharts.
