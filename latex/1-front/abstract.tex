\chapter*{Abstract}

The results of GIS research often takes the form of software libraries, written in system level languages. 
A number of these libraries, including  proj, GDAL, or CGAL, play a foundational role of almost all GIS tooling.
However, for end users, many of those libraries are usable only to a limited extend.
Features and performance get 'lost in translation' within bindings and plugins, and the applications end-users are left with are often not composable to the same degree as the libraries. 
% Performance and features get 'lost in translation' when using bindings for a different programming language, when using a plugin within an application, or worse, both.  
% Additionally, the application end-users are left with are often not composable with other applications, leading to labor intensive workflows.  
At the same time, maintainers of core libraries often find themselves in the situation of having to maintain and synchronize a great number of bindings and plugins, which limits innovation.
The limited reach of these libraries translates to a reduced societal impact, and with it, the research these libraries are based upon.

As such, the goal of this study is to make core GIS libraries more directly available to end-users.
% This study presents and prototypes a novel method which allows \ac{GIS} practitioners without a background in software development, to access the full potential of core transformation and analysis capabilities found in native \ac{GIS} libraries.
% That is based on visual programming, and static web applications. 
% The study attempts to meet this goal by designing and implementing a 
% novel method based on the fields of visual programming, and static web applications. 
% The prior works on static geo-web applications and \ac{GIS} \ac{VPL}s indicate that a strong theoretical framework is in place.
% But, and this is especially evident in the prior studies regarding Browser-based geocomputation, the practical implementation of these theories were only partially successful, and limited in scope. 
% This necessitates a practical approach in response. 
This study presents and prototypes a novel method, centered around a visual programming language to host the functionalities of GIS libraries from within an application, and in a composable manner. 
Additionally, the visual language is used to connect these libraries to a user-definable graphical user interface. 
This prototype is implemented as a static web application, so that these libraries are directly accessible to end users without installation or configuration. 
% Geodata used within the application is also exclusively statically hosted geodata, or user-submitted data. 
WebAssembly is used so that GIS libraries written in native languages only have to write one generic binding, which then can be used in any language, including this prototypical, web based visual language, thanks to a 'no boilerplate' plugin system. 
% WebAssembly is also used to run  resorting to active backend web services. 
Finally, as this prototype is intended for GIS usage, both scalability to handle sizable datasets, and rich GUI support (3D viewers, file inputs, sliders), are primary design considerations and assessment criteria.

The results of the study are carefully positive. 
This specific web-based VPL appears to be a feasible method for providing direct access to native \ac{GIS} libraries, and offers a unique set of features not found in comparable visual languages. 
The significance of this method, compared to other web-based geometry VPLs, lies in the fact that it offers a 'no-boilerplate' plugin system, in combination with a range of different \ac{GUI} nodes, certain "dataflow VPL" properties, and a proposed zero-cost abstraction runtime. 
All of these features combined lead to a VPL which is able to directly connect \ac{GUI} components with native \ac{GIS} libraries, all while remaining scalable in principle.

On a practical level, more work remains to proof this feasibility.
The methodology developed by this study is only \emph{theoretically} accessible and composable, based on achieved features. 
User-testing is required to confirm if this method indeed improves workflows, and actually saves time and energy of developers and end users. 
Moreover, the prototypical software implementation used is limited and not production ready.
Both the fact that the 'no-boilerplate' plugin system cannot be used with C / C++ \ac{GIS} libraries, and that the zero-cost abstraction runtime is not functional, must be improved upon in future work.

Despite this, it is safe to say that visual programing methods, distribution using WebAssembly, and Rust-based geocomputation, all remain valuable directions of future \ac{GIS} research.

% This method is thereafter used to load various \ac{GIS} libraries, and used in demo applications, after which an assessment can be made on its quality and the extend of its achieved functionalities. 
% The study concludes by addressing if the method meets the overarching goal.


% Geocomputation is a cornerstone of GIS \& modern mapping needs.
% While the last decades have seen major advancements, writing a geocomputational pipeline remains a complex, non-trivial exercise. 
% Performing geocomputations by utilizing a visual programming language (VPL) within a web browser is a novel development which seeks to simplify this process, allowing more people to write these types of pipelines more successfully.
% It would, in theory, allow end-users to author geocomputation pipelines, without the need of a software development background, and without the need to install software.
% utilizing a dataflow model.
% This model is the standard within VPLs dealing with geometry processing, and contains many advantages in terms of performance and reliability.

% In this context, the portability of existing geocomputation libraries is a common problem.
% This is often addressed by maintaining duplicate JavaScript alternatives to libraries such as GDAL, PROJ, and GEOS, complicating innovation.  

% This study seeks to improve the state of browser-based geocomputation VPLs by attempting to bring industry-standard geo-libraries to these environments. 
% The study poses that this can only be done if native geocomputation libraries can be \emph{compiled} to WebAssembly, \emph{loaded} into a VPL, and \emph{utilized} in a browser-based dataflow-VPL format.
% Discovering if and how these steps can be performed is the central question of this study. 
% % This study seeks to improve the state of web-based geocomputation VPLs 
% % by discovering if the library portability problem can be overcome, and if so, how.

% This question is answered by testing a possible solution.
% A proof of concept web-based VPL is designed, implemented and evaluated, which makes use of a novel plugin system, as well as a directed, acyclic graph-based data model \& interface.

% Using this proof of concept, the study was able to demonstrate that the web platform was sufficiently capable of representing a dataflow VPL capable of constructing geocomputation pipelines.
% The functional programming-properties of this dataflow VPL also makes geo-libraries sufficiently \emph{usable}, albeit with some well-known caveats of dataflow-VPLs, like the representation of conditionals and iteration.  

% The current methods of \emph{compiling} existing C++ geocomputation libraries to the web turned out to be insufficient for the purposes of this study.  
% This is due to the Emscripten compiler's focus on compiling full C++ applications instead of separate libraries. 
% Despite this, the study w√°s able to demonstrate how a novel method can be used to sufficiently \emph{compile} and \emph{load} multiple Rust-libraries for usage in the VPL, thanks to more feature-rich WebAssembly tools in the Rust ecosystem. 
% While Rusts geocomputation libraries are young, the study presents this method to either offer emscripten contributors a blueprint of a desired workflow, or to offer geocomputation library contributors a powerful use-case for the Rust language. 

% All in all, this means that either if the geocomputation libraries found in the Rust ecosystem mature, or if Emscripten's capabilities improve, then the code portability problem \& dataflow problem of existing web-based geocomputation VPLS can be solved.

%     ======================
    
%     In general, I think it's going well. I think the intro is fine, although it can be improved. I like the conclusions quite a lot, tbh. You are giving proper and interesting answers to the raised questions. The rest is a bit of a very rough draft, as I see. So, some specific points:
    
%     TODO: Tone down stuff
%     -  It seems like you have placed several bits here and there that seem like either introduction or conclusions. I feel your enthusiasm and excitement in your writing, but I think you are bringing questions and answers in places were people would normally just expect a simple narrative of what you did and what are the results.
    
%     TODO: Write 6.2
%     -  Speaking of results, we are missing the experiments so please put this at your first priority. This is because it feels like you promise things that you do not deliver.
    
%     TODO: Find & Replace
%     -  In general, you are using some very bold statements and informal expressions. The latter is kinda okay, but the first one is very dangerous. I've noticed words like "crucial", "by far" or "impressive" which seem very biased and subjective, so better be avoided. You can still use them here and there (mostly in the conclusions), but I think you use them way  too much (again, I can see your enthusiasm).
    
%     TODO: Find & Replace 
%     -  Minor thing, but I think you have confused \citet with \citep. The first one is used when the citation is part of the sentence and the latter when it's at the end of a sentence (or in a parenthesis, anyway).

%  - Performance intensive: (Big data, O(n^2) problems) 
%  - Heterogenous data (type, quality, scale, criteria, crs) 
%  - Complex (geometric) operations (linalg, bundle adjustment, procedural modelling) 
% \end{note}

% All of this makes the process of geocomputation difficult. 


% The full flowchart runs client-side in a browser, and both end results and intermediate products can be inspected in a 3D viewer.

% GeoFront offers several functionalities such as the parametric creation of 2D and 3D primitives, triangulation, isocurve extraction, and more. 
% These functionalities can be expanded upon though a plugin system which utilizes the existing "Node Package Manager" infrastructure.
% Together with WebAssembly, this enables the utilization of industry standard geoprocessing libraries such as `CGAL`, `GDAL` and `PROJ`, and data parsing libraries such as `IFC.js` and `laz-rs`.



% Following the implementation, the project was tested by simulating use-case scenarios. 
% The tests demonstrate the feasibility of [...]
% At the same time some key parameters of [...] identified which if tuned properly they can optimize the performance, behavior and robustness of the geo-web-vpl.
% With the project being a prototype solution, the vpl is far from operational and there is certainly a lot of space for improvement regarding both components.
