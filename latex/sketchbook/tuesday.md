A first step towards overcoming this challenge will be to study containerized usage of geoprocessing functionalities.

- As of right now, geo-computation libraries and tools are written in a diverse range of languages and ecosystems. 
  - C++ (CGAL, GDAL)
  - QGIS plugins
  - Arcgis plugins 
  - Python / Jupyter Notebook
  - C# / Java backends

- geoprocessing tools -> wide landscape of different toolkits and environments
-
