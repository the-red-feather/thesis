FAIR?  
Findable: WEB. 
Accessible: VPL, 
Interoperable: WASM, 
Reusable: VPL compiler


Main Question:
- Can a web-vpl make point-cloud computations more FAIR?  

Sub Questions
- Does the format of web application make point-cloud computations more **Findable**?
- Does the format of a visual programming language make point-cloud computations more **Accessible**?
- Do point-cloud geoprocessing libraries become more **Interoperable** when compiled to WebAssembly?
- Does the ability to compile a VPL script to javascript make those VPL scripts more **Reusable**?

-->

A first step towards overcoming this challenge will be to study the FAIR-ness of geoprocessing functionalities themselves.

Central to the study is ...
Within it, we will test 4 


- As of right now, geo-computation libraries and tools are written in a diverse range of languages and ecosystems. 
  - C++ (CGAL, GDAL)
  - QGIS plugins
  - Arcgis plugins 
  - Python / Jupyter Notebook
  - C# / Java backends

- Bindings, wrapper plugins, and other methods can be used to enable some interoperability,
