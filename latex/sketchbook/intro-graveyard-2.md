Web \ac{gis} forms an indispensable component of the wider geospatial software landscape. 
For the average person, an interactive \ac{gis} web application is often their first and only exposure to a \acs{gis}, be it a web mapping service, a navigation system, or a pandemic outbreak dashboard. 
A web application is cross-platform by nature, and offers ease of accessibility, since no installment or app-store interaction is required to run or update the app: 
As soon as it can be found, it can be used.
The ability to share a full application with a link, or to embed it within the larger context of a webpage is also not trivial. 
Together, these aspects have made the browser a popular host for many important geographical applications, especially when accessibility is vital.

The field of web GIS is, just like the wider context of the web, subject to many changes \& developments. 
These come in the shape of a new feature reaching a consensus in the major browser vendors, or a change in commonly used standards like the \ac{http}.
These changes may lead to a 'trend': a new way of reasoning about or organizing a web service or a web application.

- Recent improvements in the javascript runtime are a vital component of the current shift from backend-heavy to frontend-heavy web applications. 
- front-end Libraries like Celsium, Leaflet and D3 would be hard if not impossible to realize without HTML5 features like WebGL and the Canvas API.
- The cloud native geospatial movement requires the http range request feature to truly be effective.

- interplay between features and trends 
- trends lead to interesting new applications which may serve new use-cases
-> the influence and importance of the above web features and trends are why new developments within web GIS are very important to examine. 



Geofront has been created to study how recent web features and trends can have a positive effect on the accessibility of geo-computation. 
The hypothesis is that the combination of cloud-native geodata together with front-end heavy applications with industry standard geoprocessing libraries using webassembly, may lead to new, powerful types of GIS applications and use-cases. 

an experiment to capitalize on these developments within the field of web GIS. 


...
In the field of Web GIS, a pattern can be recognised between web \& browser features,  
- javascript runtime improvements -> shift from backend-heavy to frontend-heavy web applications
- HTML5 with WebGL and Canvas Api -> Celsium, Leaflet, D3
- http range request -> cloud native geospatial movement 
- WebAssembly -> ...

Now we see a new technology 

This study has been conducted for two reasons.
Firstly, this study wishes explore the possibilities \& limitations of front-end geoprocessing.
  - Web technologies have become a vital, core component of the modern geospatial software landscape.
  - However, the web is changing : cloud-native geospatial movement, move to front-end heavy applications, WebAssembly. 
  - By creating an application using these trends and technologies, we can get a better understanding.

Secondly, to experiment with making small-scale geoprocessing more accessible
accessible alternative to existing visual geo-programming environments.
