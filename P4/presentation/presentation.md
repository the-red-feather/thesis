NOTES 
==================================

Mission: 
----------------------------------

- Just go over the paper, no fancy work
- Make it MVP, then start upgrading
- Make a very straight-forward narrative
- Finish in time for mirror practice


Sunday: 
- make 


Narrative sketches:
----------------------------------

- Geocomputation

- disconnect between application and library

- VPLs are one of the ways to solve this disconnect
  - it is BOTH a programming language and an application at the same time

- VPL
  - WHY?
    - breaks the divide between 'library' and 'application'

1 Introduction
===================================

1.1 Motivation
-----------------------------------

### Geocomputation 

### Library & Application 

### Visual Programming

### The Web

1.2 Problem 
-----------------------------------

### Library Portability

### Three aspects:

### I. Compilation

### II. Loading 

### III. Usage

1.3 Objective 
-----------------------------------

### Purpose of the study
- Goal: Solving the library portability problem for web-based Vpls. 

- In doing so: Improving the state of web-based VPLs

- How: The study is about how to correctly compile, load and use libraries 
in a web-based dataflow VPL

- Research Question: 

- Sub questions:
