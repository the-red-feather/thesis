# intro

*why is geo-computation important?*
geo-computation is a process unanimous with the wider field of GIS. it involves the calculation or manipulation of geographical data. All applications of GIS, like ... , ... , ..  rely on geo-computation to be as performant and user-friendly as possible. 

However, geo-computation is challenging due to the nature of geodata:
- Big Data: The sizable nature of geodata makes geo-computation both computationally intensive and unwieldy. 

- Variety in formats: 

- Variety in quality

- lots of edge cases


Also 

- pipelines are extremely complex, hard to find the right process, to get insight into how different settings could lead to different results. 

.....

It is for all of these reasons that geo-computation processes are often developed on small, test datasets. 


prefered format: scripts


several methods are created to make all of this easier: 

*why are vpls used for geo-computation?* 
- Parametrization: 
- Experimentation: 

*why is the web used for geo-computation?*
- Accessibility: no installment or configuration burden
- Collaboration: web applications can quickly be distributed

these  niceties of a vpl or of the web have always had significant drawbacks

# problem: 

- geoprocessing using either the web or vpls is niche, underdeveloped. This leads to the disadvantages being over-emphasised, and the advantages underappreciated. 
- no way of both using the advantages of the web and a vpl, since no geo-computation web vpl exist.
