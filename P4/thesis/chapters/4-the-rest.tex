\chapter{Conclusion}%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% CHAPTER
repeat results and answers in shortened form

\chapter{Discussion}%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% CHAPTER
Many considerations

\section{Self-assessment}


\section{Reproducibility}
Reproducibility
Results themselves are insanely reproducable. 
Software can be used, you can reproduce results easely by dumping versions of geofront in 
a folder.

\dots

Software can also be build without too many difficulties, but the procedure has some unconventional build steps: 

\dots

\section{Future Work}
Boulevard of broken dreams :)
