\chapter{Discussion}%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% CHAPTER
Many considerations

% _Answer research questions !!!!_


% ## Accessibility
% _"Is this environment truly accessible?"_


% ## Practical 
% _"Is this environment truly a competitor to native / other methods of geoprocessing?"_

% ## As Demo / Scripting Environment 
% _"Is this environment a good demo host?"_


\section{Self-assessment}


\section{Reproducibility}
Reproducibility
Results themselves are insanely reproducable.
Software can be used, you can reproduce results easely by dumping versions of geofront in 
a folder.

\dots

Software can also be build without too many difficulties, but the procedure has some unconventional build steps: 

\dots

BUT, the code is not the cleanest, nor the most conventional. minus points on open-source accessibility.

\section{Future Work}
Boulevard of broken dreams :) 

_This thesis has only scratched the surface of all that _

- Geofront as web-based version of grasshopper
- Geofront as lightweight QGIS replacement
