#  1. INTRODUCTION 
<!-- _[JF]: I THINK I SHOULD EXCLUDE THE WHOLE IDEA OF CLIENT SIDE GEOPROCESSING._ -->
<!-- _[JF]: BE MORE HONEST. MENTION THE VISUAL PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE._ -->
<!-- ALSO: I could do a rewrite from a visual scripting perspective -->

<!-- The web could do so much more. I will proof this by making a visual programming language using almost exclusively the tools given by the browser -->

<!-- Under normal circumstances, Web applications within the field of geo-informatics are mostly used for the first and final stages of a common geodata process.  
(
If one wishes to retrieve geodata, web portals are used to discover the required datasets. After this, the OGC Web Services are often utilized to download and truly access this geodata. 

This geodata is then processed locally, using QGIS, ArcGIS, command line tools, or any other 

and at the end Tools like Leaflet and Celcium have been created to visualize the earth in both 2D and 3D , and tools like d3.js can produce interactive graphs to supplement these web pages. 

There is, however, more to the web than just visualization. Due to

This thesis asks the question if the web could do more than just visualization. 

By creating the use-case application GeoFront, we ask the question if a modern web browser, and the current state of the client-side web technologies are capable of facilitating

<!-- Geofront: Features: 
- Build by utilizing only basic web features ( excluding webpack & typescript )
- Visual Scripting on the web

Take example from 'game jam':
- web games vs local games
- prototyping stage

## Motivation
Under normal circumstances, Web applications within the field of geo-informatics are mostly used for the first and final stages of a common geodata process: Retrieval and visualization. 
The processing stages in-between are almost always performed on the desktop using environments like QGIS or ArcGIS, or by writing and using CLI tools. 

<!-- At the same time, a need arrises -->

## This Study

This thesis explores if these in-between processing steps could also be performed within a web application.  
This way, geodata processing applications could profit from the ease of accessibility and maintainability granted by the web as a platform.  

<!-- More Why's: 
- making the geoweb more feature-rich
- allowing quick demonstration (wapm)
- allowing easy access (overleaf)


 -->

(similar to how overleaf is more accessible than desktop latex installation & usage)

We ask ourselves if the current state of client-side web technologies are capable of facilitating multiple steps of geodata conversion, and what such an application would look like. 

To concretize this question, this study covers the design and creation a use-case application titled "Geofront". 

By designing and creating this environment, the study seeks to gain valuable insights in the current state of client-side core web technologies / javascript std, and how well this facilitates various geoprocessing operations.

<!-- Geofronts main interface will be a visual scripting environment.  -->

<!-- [geodata processing] LEADS TO [automation] LEADS TO [scripting]. 
[scripting] + [accessible] = visual programming  -->

<!-- (Go to visual scripting)

(the old stuff)

Interactive, browser-based giss form an indispensable component of the modern geospatial software landscape. 
Despite the popularity of geographical web applications, the range of actual gis! abilities these applications are capable of is very limited. 
This limited range of capabilities inhibits the number of users and use cases geographical web applications can serve, and with it the usefulness of web gis as a whole.
But, Why is geoprocessing within a web application as of today still nowhere to be found? -->


<!-- ## Obstacles + Problem Statement
csg is technically challenging.
csg is immature.
csg can be considered unnecessary.

## This Study

<!-- [JF]: Screw: "adjusting its methodoology to tackle key components", be more direct: -->
<!-- This study prioritizes a concrete approach. As such,  -->

<!-- Therefore, This study will make a new, wholistic attempt at actualizing client-side geoprocessing. 
It will differ from previous attempts by adjusting its methodology to tackle key components of all three obstacles, in order to enable the widespread adoption of csg. -->
