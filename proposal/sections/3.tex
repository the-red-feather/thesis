% [HUGO]: The research questions are clearly defined, along with the scope (ie what you will not be doing).
% To help you define a "good" research question, 
% read \url{https://sites.duke.edu/urgws/files/2014/02/Research-Questions_WS-handout.pdf}.
% [ From Hugo's handout: ]
% 
% clear | focussed | unique | 
% start asking open-ended “How?” “What?” and Why?” questions. 
% Then evaluate possible responses to those questions
% While a good research question allows the writer to take an arguable position, 
% it DOES NOT leave room for ambiguity.
% 
% 1)Is the research question something I/others care about? Is it arguable?
% 2)Is the research question a new spin on an old idea, or does it solve a problem?
% 3)Is it too broad or too narrow?
% 4)Is the research question researchable within the given time frame and location?
% 5)What information is needed?
% 
% are you trying to accomplish one of these goals? 
% 1) Define or measure a specific fact or gather facts about a specific phenomenon. -> NO
% 2) Match facts and theory. -> NO
% 3) Evaluate and compare two theories, models, or hypotheses. -> NO
% 4) Prove that a certain method is more effective than other methods. -> ONLY WASM compared to native
% Moreover, the research question should address what the variables of the experiment are, their relationship, 
% and state something about the testing ofthose relationships. 
% 
% [JF] : I really know what I want to do, and I am convinced improving the usability of geoprocessing tools 
% is both valuable and Good.

\section{Scope}


\subsection{Will Include}


\subsubsection*{Features and limitations of using wasm for geoprocessing}


\subsubsection*{Performance analysis of C++ geoprocessing libraries native versus wasm}


\subsubsection*{Implementation details of creating a geo-web-vpl}
Design decisions informed by research (the VPL usability paper) and previous vpl's.

The paper will state usability considerations within the implementation details of the VPL, but will make no attempt to proof these statements. 

\subsection{Will not include}



\subsubsection*{Usability Analysis of geoprocessing VPL's}

While usability* is the primary motivation for conducting this research, no claims will be made that a client-side vpl geoprocessing environment is actually a superior geoprocessing method. This research attempts to solve technological inhibitions in order to proof whether or not this is \textbf{an} option. If it turns out that this method is viable technically, future research will be needed to definitively proof \textbf{how} usable it is compared to all other existing methods.  

* (Usability within this context is meant as a collection of aspects such as "performance", "ease of use", and FAIR principles. )

\subsubsection*{Web Processing Services}

This research will exclude web processing services, since these services are not about \emph{client} side geoprocessing, but instead cover \emph{server} side geoprocessing. 
Future work could, however, research the possibility of utilizing a vpl for server orchestration.
