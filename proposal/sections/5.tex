% \section{Methodology}
% This research attempts to improve the Accessibility and Interoperability issues of VPL's by % developing a prototype VPL. 
% This prototype will be used as the stage to develop the tools and knowledge necessary to % utilize the Web \& WebAssembly for geodata processing.   
% 
% \par
% A logbook will be maintained to explain how this prototype was constructed, what design % choices were made and why, and exactly in which way the FAIR principles influenced its % design. 
% 
% \par
% When the VPL contains all tools necessary to be used to properly process geodata, a final % assessment is needed. 
% Three different applications will be created using regular means (jupyter notebook, python, % panda's, etc)
% and these same applications will be created using the prototype web-VPL. 
% These two methods will then be compared on usability aspects and performance.
