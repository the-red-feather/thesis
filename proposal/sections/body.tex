% An introduction in which the relevance of the project and its place in the 
% context of geomatics is described, along with a clearly-defined problem statement.
\section{Introduction}

% 1. geodata processing is important 
% 2. vpl's makes geodata processing debugable and more insightful. 
% 3. BUT current VPL's lack certain aspects
% 4. use FAIR paradigm to criticize current VPL's 
% 5. go from this to research question

% [JF]: This is super nice, By 'improving a VPL' I dont have to go all 'use case testing' and make a case for a vpl, 
% because I can just state in this introduction "they are useful, look, multiple people are working on them"


\subsection{"making the Case"}

\subsubsection{Findable}
la la la 

\subsubsection{Accessible}
Most vpl's are not 


\subsubsection{Interoperable}
la la la 

\subsubsection{Reusable}
reusability is arguably the main reason why code is important: a structured way of defining a process. 
This way the process itself can be taken and used in different contexts.
vpl's are often not reusable in the same way as code. they are strongly tied to their host environments

% Having a Gantt chart is probably a better idea then just a list.

% Since specific data and tools have to be used, itâ€™s good to present these concretely, 
% so that the mentors know that you have a grasp of all aspects of the project.
