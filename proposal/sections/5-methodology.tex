\section{Methodology}

The methodology, in board terms, involves two subsequent projects. The first project is the development of the aforementioned web based visual programming language. This development will be done incrementally, where in between steps 

The second project seeks to "infuse" this application with WebAssembly. This can start halfway during the development of the first project. 





% This research attempts to improve the Accessibility and Interoperability issues of VPL's by % developing a prototype VPL. 
% This prototype will be used as the stage to develop the tools and knowledge necessary to % utilize the Web \& WebAssembly for geodata processing.   
% 
% \par
% A logbook will be maintained to explain how this prototype was constructed, what design % choices were made and why, and exactly in which way the FAIR principles influenced its % design. 
% 
% \par
% When the VPL contains all tools necessary to be used to properly process geodata, a final % assessment is needed. 
% Three different applications will be created using regular means (jupyter notebook, python, % panda's, etc)
% and these same applications will be created using the prototype web-VPL. 
% These two methods will then be compared on usability aspects and performance.
