# [ ------- FROM THE GEO2020 WEBSITE ------- ] #

[Hugo]: The document for P2 is a research proposal that must contain:
- We expect a project plan to be around 10-15 pages (maximum). 
- It should show that you clearly know the problem you plan to solve, and that you master the related work. 
- We expect you to present the methodology you will use to solve your scientific problem(s), and to present preliminary results. 
- Also, this is a scientific proposal, so references are mandatory (even if there is no specific section in the template).

It should contain: 
  1. An introduction in which the relevance of the project and its place in the context of geomatics is described, along with a clearly-defined problem statement;
  2. A related work section in which the relevant literature is presented and linked to the project;
  3. The research questions are clearly defined, along with the scope (ie what you will not be doing); to help you define a “good” research question, read this document
  4. Overview of the methodology to be used;
  5. Time planning—having a 'Gantt chart' is probably a better idea than just a list;
  6. Since specific data and tools have to be used, it’s good to present these concretely, so that the mentors know that you have a grasp of all aspects of the project;
  7. References.
