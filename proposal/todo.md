 P2 template

 The document for P2 is a research proposal that must contain:
 - all the elements listed in the template available in the graduation manual (Appendix 2).
 - You are free to write your project plan with the word processor of your choice (including LaTeX), as long as all the asked parts are present, in the same order. You can use that simple LaTeX template as starting point.
   - (LaTeX is strongly recommended tho...) [JF]: Ill try to use markdown for the time being. I think I will not need the advanced features of LaTeX (just yet). 
 - We expect a project plan to be around 10-15 pages (maximum). 
 - It should show that you clearly know the problem you plan to solve, 
 - and that you master the related work. 
 - We expect you to present the methodology you will use to solve your scientific problem(s), and to present preliminary results. 
 - Also, this is a scientific proposal, so references are mandatory (even if there is no specific section in the template).

 As an example, here’s a good project plan from a previous year. It contains:
  - an introduction in which the relevance of the project and its place in the context of geomatics is described, along with a clearly-defined problem statement;
  - a related work section in which the relevant literature is presented and linked to the project;
  - the research questions are clearly defined, along with the scope (ie what you will not be doing); to help you define a “good” research question, read this document
  - overview of the methodology to be used;
  - time planning—having a 'Gantt chart' is probably a better idea than just a list;
  - since specific data and tools have to be used, it’s good to present these concretely, so that the mentors know that you have a grasp of all aspects of the project;
  - the references.
