# Personal Reflection

A thesis is, among many things, an attempt to formulate. 
To clarify and structure a phenomenon, as much for yourself as for the public. 
This thesis can also be regarded as such an attempt. 
I tried to understand a phenomenon you might call: "End User Geodata Processing". 
To what extent can the activity of geocomputation truly be made "publicly available", including the automation aspects of it?
I see this in much similar terms to the "Teach a man how to fish..." saying.
Providing open geodata and a range of applications to the public is great, but we might only be "Giving a man a fish so he can eat for a day".
By providing geocomputation tools in a fashion usable by end users, we could give the general public more authorship and autonomy over geodata. 
And, more concretely, if a person themselves can compute what they want, when they want it, we don't have to pre-process several variants of the same dataset, tweaked to suit different audiences, saving storage and especially processing time.

I did not have this clear of a goal at the start of the thesis, only intuitions and a set of loosely coupled ideas.
I still think the ideas presented are not as refined as they could have been. 
I was also unable to find a foundational body of work to base this research on. 
What I did know is that I did not want to stay at a theoretical level. 
I wanted to truly **build** a solution, to the at this point ill-defined problem. 

In hindsight, I don't think it was wise to build a concrete software implementation based on multiple, loosely defined theories. 
This imbalance led to a time-consuming complication between research and software implementation while writing the thesis.

Nevertheless, through many iterations, I was eventually able to integrate both the ideas and the thesis at large with this software implementation.
I have learned two additional major lessons from conducting this study: 
One, writing well is hard work. 
Boiling a story down to the essentials asks a great deal of time and energy. 
I would not call the current story this study tells concise, but it is much more precise than I was able to write at the beginning of this adventure.

And two, I must learn to rely on the work of others.
This is difficult, as it is contrary to my personal conviction on the great importance of "learning from scratch".
Both the software implementation and the written thesis had me figuring out a lot of aspects from scratch, and this had advantages and disadvantages.
The advantage is that 'doing the work again yourself', is probably one of the most educational endeavors one can do. 
We must understand the inner workings of the systems we work with, and especially of the systems we wish to improve. 
 
This is why I took the risk of developing many aspects of this thesis anew. 
Even if this might turn out to be a parallel study, it would only reinforce the 're' in research. 

The disadvantage of doing this, is that you prevent yourself from being able to 'stand on the shoulders of giants'.
I especially felt the sting of this lesson in the written aspect of this thesis. 
Not really knowing up from down because of having no readily available work to build on caused countless hours of revision.
Another great disadvantage is that you run the risk of alienating both yourself and your endeavors. 
By building from existing starting points, you connect your work with the works of others, and in doing so contributing to a wider community.

If you have read this thesis up to this point, I want to sincerely thank you for your time and interest.
With this thesis, and despite these shortcomings, I hope to have provided you and the wider geospatial community with something of value.
