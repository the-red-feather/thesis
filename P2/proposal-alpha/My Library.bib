	abstract = {The maturation of the Web platform has given rise to sophisticated and demanding Web applications such as interactive 3D visualization, audio and video software, and games. With that, efficiency and security of code on the Web has become more important than ever. Yet JavaScript as the only built-in language of the Web is not well-equipped to meet these requirements, especially as a compilation target. Engineers from the four major browser vendors have risen to the challenge and collaboratively designed a portable low-level bytecode called WebAssembly. It offers compact representation, efficient validation and compilation, and safe low to no-overhead execution. Rather than committing to a specific programming model, WebAssembly is an abstraction over modern hardware, making it language-, hardware-, and platform-independent, with use cases beyond just the Web. WebAssembly has been designed with a formal semantics from the start. We describe the motivation, design and formal semantics of WebAssembly and provide some preliminary experience with implementations.},

	abstract = {WebAssembly (Wasm) is a safe, portable virtual instruction set that can be hosted in a wide range of environments, such as a Web browser. It is a low-level language whose instructions are intended to compile directly to bare hardware. While the initial version of Wasm focussed on single-threaded computation, a recent proposal extends it with low-level support for multiple threads and atomic instructions for synchronised access to shared memory. To support the correct compilation of concurrent programs, it is necessary to give a suitable specification of its memory model. Wasm's language definition is based on a fully formalised specification that carefully avoids undefined behaviour. We present a substantial extension to this semantics, incorporating a relaxed memory model, along with a few proposed extensions. Wasm's memory model is unique in that its linear address space can be dynamically grown during execution, while all accesses are bounds-checked. This leads to the novel problem of specifying how observations about the size of the memory can propagate between threads. We argue that, considering desirable compilation schemes, we cannot give a sequentially consistent semantics to memory growth. We show that our model provides sequential consistency for data-race-free executions (SC-DRF). However, because Wasm is to run on the Web, we must also consider interoperability of its model with that of JavaScript. We show, by counter-example, that JavaScript's memory model is not SC-DRF, in contrast to what is claimed in its specification. We propose two axiomatic conditions that should be added to the JavaScript model to correct this difference. We also describe a prototype SMT-based litmus tool which acts as an oracle for our axiomatic model, visualising its behaviours, including memory resizing.},

	abstract = {We present Emscripten, a compiler from LLVM (Low Level Virtual Machine) assembly to JavaScript. This opens up two avenues for running code written in languages other than JavaScript on the web: (1) Compile code directly into LLVM assembly, and then compile that into JavaScript using Emscripten, or (2) Compile a language's entire runtime into LLVM and then JavaScript, as in the previous approach, and then use the compiled runtime to run code written in that language. For example, the former approach can work for C and C++, while the latter can work for Python; all three examples open up new opportunities for running code on the web. Emscripten itself is written in JavaScript and is available under the MIT license (a permissive open source license), at http://www.emscripten.org. As a compiler from LLVM to JavaScript, the challenges in designing Emscripten are somewhat the reverse of the norm - one must go from a low-level assembly into a high-level language, and recreate parts of the original high-level structure of the code that were lost in the compilation to low-level LLVM. We detail the methods used in Emscripten to deal with those challenges, and in particular present and prove the validity of Emscripten's Relooper algorithm, which recreates high-level loop structures from low-level branching data.},

	abstract = {JavaScript is the most widely used language for web programming, and now increasingly becoming popular for high performance computing, data-intensive applications, and deep learning. More recently, WebAssembly has been introduced as a typed low-level bytecode representation which promises to enable better performance. Sparse matrix-vector multiplication (SpMV) is an important kernel that is considered critical for the performance of compute-intensive applications. In SpMV, the optimal selection of storage format is one of the key aspects of enabling the best performance. This paper describes the distinctive nature of the performance and choice of optimal sparse matrix storage format for sequential SpMV for the managed languages JavaScript and WebAssembly, as compared to native languages like C. We performed exhaustive experiments with 2000 real-life sparse matrices. To evaluate the experimental data in a rigorous manner we introduced the notion of x\%-affinity which allows us to identify with certainty those storage formats that are at least x\% better than all other formats. We explored three main research questions. First, we examined the difference in performance between native C and both JavaScript and WebAssembly, for two major browsers, Firefox and Chrome. For JavaScript, we observed that the best performing browser demonstrated a slowdown of only 2.2x to 5.8x versus C. Somewhat surprisingly, for WebAssembly, we observed similar or better performance as compared to C, for the best performing browser. Second, we explored the performance of single-precision versus double-precision SpMV. In contrast to C, in JavaScript and WebAssembly, we found that double-precision is often more efficient than single-precision. Lastly, we examined the choice of optimal storage format. Interestingly, the best format choices are very different for C as compared to both JavaScript and WebAssembly, and even quite different between the two browsers.},

This study examines what happens when that processing load is shifted to the client using JavaScript to process geospatial data directly in the browser. The results indicated that the server was faster than the client in all testing scenarios, and only when processing generalized small scale data, was the client performance in an acceptable time range. These results demonstrated that the current implementation of web browsers are limited in their ability to execute JavaScript geoprocessing and not yet prepared to process data sizes larger than about 7,000 to 10,000 vertices before either prompting an unresponsive script warning in the browser or potentially losing the interest of the user.},

The collection of vast amounts of environmental data increased the demand for applications which can manage and process large-scale and high-resolution data sets in real-time. One of the important tasks for organizing and customizing hydrological data sets is the delineation of watersheds on demand. Watershed delineation is a process for creating a boundary that represents the contributing area for a specific control point or water outlet, with the intent of characterization and analysis of portions of a study area. Although many GIS tools and software are available for watershed analysis on desktop systems, there is a need for optimized libraries for client-side and server-side web applications for creating a dynamic and interactive environment for exploring hydrological data. In this project, we developed and demonstrated several watershed delineation techniques on the web, with seven different use cases implemented on the client-side using JavaScript, WebAssembly, and WebGL and on the server-side using Python, Go, C, and Node.js. We also developed a client-side GPGPU (General Purpose Graphical Processing Unit) algorithm to analyze high-resolution terrain data for watershed delineation by benefiting from the parallelizable nature of GPUs. The web-based real-time analysis of watershed segmentation can be helpful for decision-makers and stakeholders while eliminating the need of installing complex software packages and dealing with large-scale data sets.},

	abstract = {The cognitive dimensions framework is a broad-brush evaluation technique for interactive devices and for non-interactive notations. It sets out a small vocabulary of terms designed to capture the cognitively-relevant aspects of structure, and shows how they can be traded off against each other. The purpose of this paper is to propose the framework as an evaluation technique for visual programming environments. We apply it to two commercially-available dataflow languages (with further examples from other systems) and conclude that it is effective and insightful; other HCI-based evaluation techniques focus on different aspects and would make good complements. Insofar as the examples we used are representative, current VPLs are successful in achieving a good ‘closeness of match’, but designers need to consider the ‘viscosity ’ (resistance to local change) and the ‘secondary notation’ (possibility of conveying extra meaning by choice of layout, colour, etc.).},
