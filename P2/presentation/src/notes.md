<!--------------------------------- [ 0. Intro ] ---------------------------->

- Thank you for coming!

- Today I wish to share my master thesis proposal with you. 

- My Masters thesis for Geomatics for the Built Environment

- On the topic of Accessible, browser-based Geoprocessing.


---

- I will first explain to you what 'Client-side Geoprocessing' exactly means and **Why** it motivates this study 

- We can then go into **What** specifically this study seeks out to do.   

- And after that, **How** this study will be carried out.

<!--------------------------------- [ 1. Motivation / Why ] ------------------>
# WHY

But first, the why

---

## GEODATA 

CORE 
- geodata in desision making,
- all the other benefits

## WEB plays vital role in distribution of geodata
Google maps, 
Open Street map, 
Dutch Government, 
PDOK Web Portal

## BUT, Web Portals are often limited 




## WHY : THE GEOWEB 

CSG -> GeoWeb -> The Geoweb Application

Google maps , Open Street map, Dutch Government, 
- Explain significance of web applications

- Why there are so many

- GeoWeb studies concerned with sharability of data. 



## BUT 
HERE we run into the limitations of the current state of the art

- not _exactly_ what was asked for by the user
  - Too much / too little information 
  - Post-Processing With whatever tools the user knows (Illustrator, Blender) 
  - _Easier to just draw on top of google maps screenshots_

- If the shared geodata cannot easily and readily be used by a wider audience, then we will never see the widespead geodata usage the field of geomatics has been promoting 

## Major Cause: no geoprocessing available. 

- Data has to be pre-processed 
- Data 

## Nobel Cause: bring geodata processing to the masses



## What is preventing it, What can be do

---
<!--------------------------------- [ 2. Problem / What] --------------------->

## Problem
---

- Using the results of multiple prior studies, three obstacles are identified, hindering browser-based geodata processing.
