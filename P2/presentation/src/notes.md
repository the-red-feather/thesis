<!--------------------------------- [ 1. Motivation / Why ] ------------------>
# WHY

But first, the why

---

## GEOMATICS
- CORE VALUE OF GEOMATICS : spatial insight into surroundings

## GEODATA 
- We do this by developing and promoting open geodata. 

- geodata in desision making,
- all the other benefits

## WEB plays vital role in distribution of geodata
Google maps, 
Open Street map, 
Dutch Government, 
PDOK Web Portal

## BUT, Suffer from limitation: 
- only visualize

- we sometimes call them web gis, even though they do not utilize a great many GIS tools.  

- If the shared geodata cannot easily and readily be used by a wider audience, then we will never see the widespead geodata usage the field of geomatics has been promoting 

## Major Cause: No geoprocessing available. 

- Data has to be pre-processed 
- Data 

## Nobel Cause: bring geodata processing to the masses



## What is preventing it, What can be do

## Problem

- Using the results of multiple prior studies, three obstacles are identified, hindering browser-based geodata processing.
