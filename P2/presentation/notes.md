# WHY

But first, the why

---

## GEOMATICS
- CORE VALUE OF GEOMATICS : spatial insight into surroundings

## GEODATA 
- We do this by developing and promoting open geodata. 

- geodata in desision making,
- all the other benefits

## WEB plays vital role in distribution of geodata
Google maps, 
Open Street map, 
Dutch Government, 
PDOK Web Portal

## BUT, Suffer from limitation: 
- only visualize



- If the shared geodata cannot easily and readily be used by a wider audience, then we will never see the widespead geodata usage the field of geomatics has been promoting
