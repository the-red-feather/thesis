# meeting 1 

Ken, Stelios & me had our first talk. Kind of all over the place, mainly due to my lack of preparation (and sleep, thanks to Koningsdag). What was important to me was their general opinion of the topic. I was very happy to hear many concrete use-cases this research could have, and Ken & Stelios' general openness to the ideas.

What shape or form this could take remains unclear. 


During the talk, I discovered that that I need to be more specific 



# TODO for next meeting:

- Make the focus clear of the library. 'geometry processing' is a bit to broad. Ken proposes 'triangulation' as just something that is always very much needed. 
- Finish the 
- Plan an actual date for the meeting
