Intro
=====

What I promised last meeting
============================

```
-> Build something? Build something!
   -> I will finish the Research Assignment(RA), to gain vital insight in `rust-wasm-javascript` interactions
   -> I will set the first baby steps in creating the visual programming language (VPL)
   -> I will use the RA + VPL as a take-off point.
   -> I will create some sort of roadmap
```

Results from last meeting
======================================


.1. cityjson Validator : latest updates 
---------------------------------------


.2. flowchart / nodes application, first results, and roadmap
-------------------------------------------------------------


- Type checking is not something to think lightly of. 
- Json solution? 
- Type checking = Type Validation = a big deal!

```
MeshToJson() {
}
```

Don't automate too many things

...

many times a type is not whats important, its the data within
Wrapping is hard to avoid

...

We define the types (and essentially, create a new language, large wrappers, etc.)
vs 
We delegate everything to the language (and inherrit its problems. Not exactly user friendly)

...

geoflow deserves a second look.



.3. the internship
------------------

Set up meeting! 



Promises for the next meeting
=============================

I will
- Finish up till Phase 2 
- Think about how to implement types
